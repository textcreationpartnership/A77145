         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>P. <hi>22.</hi> it's cleered up to rationall men, the regaining of the <hi>Phenix</hi> Friggot was no diſturbance to the Great Dukes Port.</p>

            <p>P. <hi>27, 28, 29.</hi> relate how it was not Capt. <hi>Badileys</hi> ordering Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> to haſten out to him as for life, but his breach of a firſt and ſecond Order or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that next to a hand of God againſt them, proved the ruine of that Squadron: And Capt. <hi>Wood</hi> at his going out of the world confeſt, Capt. <hi>Badiley</hi> was not at all to blame, but themſelves, in not following Order.</p>

            <p>P. <hi>33.34, 35, 36.</hi> declares the fallaciouſneſſe of that part of his Remonſtrance, which ſaith Capt. <hi>Ell,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Fiſher</hi> would have relieved the <hi>Leopard,</hi> but Capt. <hi>Badiley</hi> would not doe that worke himſelfe, nor ſuffer them to doe it.</p>
            <p>P. <hi>37, 38.</hi> doth manifeſt the great ridiculouſneſſe and vanity in the Remonſtrance, to relate what a company of drunken Eum-boat men, or he knowes not who, ſaid to the reproach of Capt. <hi>Badiley,</hi> upon his leaving <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorn</hi> as he did, thinking thereby to diſparage him.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T's more then three months ſince I came home, out of the Mediteranian Sea; and none, high or low, hath ſaid to my face, this or that hath bin il done by you, whilſt you were on the ſaid Voiage.</p>
            <p>Yet about the time that Captain <hi>Appleton's</hi> Remonſtrance was given in, as thoſe that triumph before Victory, news muſt needs be carried to my Relations in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily (whileſt I was abſent) a file of Muſquetiers was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for me, to carry me to the Power; another friend com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my houſe, ſaid, the Watermen upon the Thames gave out I was gone to priſon, and this Report was raiſed about <hi>Chattam,</hi> and the <hi>Exchange:</hi> But when I heard thereof, and that ſome were troubled at it, I anſwered; <hi>One that is accuſed of theft, and never plaid the Thief, either directly, or indirectly, he knows not wherein he is guilty: So I know not of any offence to the State, that I can be made capable of.</hi> Surely therefore, before they do ſuch a thing, they will tell me for what, and wherefore it is.</p>
            <p>I ſhal now crave leave to make a little further deviation, before I come to anſwer the contrivers of the Remonſtrance, who have thereby kindled a fire which is like to end I know not where. And in the firſt place I ſhall lay down before you, how I have laboured to deliver, and by multiplyed acts of civility have endeavoured to ingage theſe who appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:135601:6"/>
            <p>He ſaith in his <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> whereas his ſicknes and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Witherages</hi> death was cauſe of his not coming forth to aſſiſt me (although I wanted not Information enough) as by the Letters appeareth, which herewith I preſent you, how backward he was to come out, and how unready the Ships were to do ſervice: ſo that among others, his great Friend, the great Duke, that knew very wel how he did, expounded it not to be ſickneſs, but treachery; for who knows not, that a man may draw up a Commiſſion in an hour, and he might have done it as well then for Captain <hi>Line,</hi> as he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to joſtle out Captain <hi>Cox:</hi> And if a man have an Ague, or ſome ſuch ſmal diſtemper, an Engagement with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie may ſhake it off ſooner, then a Cartooch of <hi>Grego.</hi> But if it would not, muſt therefore ſuch a peice of the Nations ſtrength lye ſtill, when there is an opportunity of doing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and in his power either to put in another man, or elſe to ſit in his Gabbin and order others to do the buſineſs? And although in his firſt, ſecond, and third Letter he mentions nothing of his ſickneſs to me; and though Mr. <hi>Morgan Reed</hi> the Nations Conſul, laments to me greatly of his dulneſs in ſeveral Letters within a few days one after another; as alſo Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> the States publick Miniſter in ſundrie of his Letters, ſaying, he had little or no mind to do ſervice for the State; and in one Letter ſaith, If Captain <hi>Appleton</hi> would have followed his counſel (rather then the advice of others, the chief of which he declares in ſome Letters, made open defiance to the State) we bad joyn'd our Forces, and ſo I had not been left to fight the Enemie all alone; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding much more wrote againſt him by Captain <hi>Wood</hi> and others, for his backwardneſs; yet for all this, when I wrote to the Higher Powers about him, I did, as it were, take a Mantle and cover his failings, and miſcarriages, uſing but his own words, ſaying, I beleeved, or judg'd his ſickneſs and Captain <hi>Withrages</hi> death retarded the coming out of thoſe Ships to our aſſiſtance Again, when he did that filly act in his own perſon, fetching a <hi>Dutch</hi> man out of the Great Dukes Centinels houſe, becauſe he reſcued the <hi>Fleming:</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which came all our trouble about the <hi>Phaenix,</hi> as ſaith
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135601:6"/>Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> by his Letters; and he that will open his eyes, may ſee, that if that fooliſh buſineſs had not been, there had not an extraordinary Meſſenger been ſent from the great Duke into <hi>England,</hi> complaining of him; and conſequently there had not been ſo much diſcontent given him in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by that perſon, as made the Dukes Secretary ſay pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly on the place of <hi>Legorn,</hi> the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had ſent his Maſter ſo much poyſon when they ſent him that Letter.</p>
            <p>I ſay, notwithſtanding this, when as he was ſent to me as a Priſoner to <hi>Porte Longone,</hi> that I might do juſtice on him, really pittying his Condition, I deſired ſome of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to wait on him from <hi>Porta Feraro;</hi> and when he came, although ſomthing was done in a private civil way, that the Duke might not be greatly enrag'd, when as we ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to mock at his juſtice; yet he knows I did effectually end eavour to help him out of that trouble; and when he had made his <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> to ſend home, wherein he weakly declared his men forc'd him aſhore to the Mould, I hope him to make a better <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> then ſo; and if he had come to acknowledg'd my Favours, I might have helpt him to draw up one now, according to the tenor of Truth more to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute then this, that is ful of horrid Falſities; If I had direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to write thus, it had been according to very truth, Briefly.</p>
            <p>When God was pleaſed to give us a very good opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, inſomuch that we might have relieved C. <hi>Badiley,</hi> if we had had hearts to have been unanimous, and had vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſecuted it, or had wils to take his counſel in coming out in the night, as we ought to have done; but omitting it, the Lord was pleaſed ſo to order it, by the alteration of Winds which are in his fiſts, that when the ſaid <hi>Badiley</hi> would have reliev'd us, and have cleer'd us of <hi>Legorn,</hi> he was made unable and uncapable of hindring, or preventing our Ruin and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>To come to the buſineſs of <hi>Legorn,</hi> when he came thither in his home-ward way, at the time when the great Duke had newly declared we muſt be gone to engage the Enemie, let
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135601:7"/>the ods be what it will; I ſay ſeeing me now buſie in fitting the Ship with all Accoutrements for an engagement, and filing a Veſſel with Lumber to make the Ships ready and clear, when as he was making up his things to go for <hi>Genoa,</hi> for his friend. The great Duke declared he ſhould not ſtay in his Territories, or come aſhore into his Town, he comes to me; Oh ſaith he, this almoſt breaks my heart, to think that you ſhould go to fight, and I go home to anſwer what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd againſt me. My Lieutenant alſo having heard him ſadly expreſs, he knew they ſent for him into <hi>England</hi> to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his life: Truly I could not but pity the man, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Captain <hi>Appleton,</hi> it's a dangerous thing to dally with the Commands of the Councel of State: But ſince the Captain of this Ship, <hi>Jonas Pool,</hi> cannot be ſent for from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> in any time, if you be real indeed, and that your peace can be made with the great Duke, I will be your friend to further you all that lyeth in my power, and to that purpoſe Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> and a Councell of Officers ſhall be called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſider of the buſineſs; and there upon Debate it was concluded in the Affirmative, if he could procure that leave as before: Oh but then how ſhould he get that leave! I anſwered not (at that private meeting or Councell) as he in his <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> (like ſome Chancery Bils) ſaith, it was then agreed he ſhould give ſix hundred Dollars to buy his peace, which is a moſt notorious untruth, there was not one word about Dollars ſpoken there; but I ſaid to him, your beſt way in my opinion was, to confer with Conſul <hi>Read,</hi> who hath great friends at Court, and it may be by means of a little greace to his Highneſs Secretary, or Maſter of the Ceremonies, and upon your humble ſubmiſſion he wil remit your offence; and it ſeems it was ſo effected after I was gone: but if it coſt him more to do it then his feaſting with the great Duke was worth, it will ſhew he hath been as ſimple as he is now malitious. In all ages ſome there be that will reward others evil for their good; I think it would have been a good buſineſs for this man, who feared the queſtioning of his life at home, to have an opportunity given him, that by his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry in Service, he might have done ſomthing to remove
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135601:7"/>that fear, as alſo the diſ-reputation, which otherwiſe he could not.</p>
            <p>And then as to his Engagement at laſt, wheras no effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al courſe was taken to rid himſelf of thoſe ſhips that were on board him, after our example in the <hi>Paragon,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a great number of men were killed and wounded on the upper Deck and elſe-where, to the number of about fourſcore, ſo that all was ordered to withdraw thence but the Commander himſelf; and howbeit almoſt as many were run down into holes, the Enemy being bord and bord: and although the Fleet had all left her without any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet three or fourſcore men was got up to bear away the Enemy by main force of hand; how much more ſhould they have done it, that had ſo much encouragement as their Admiral, and other their friends, to be within two or three ſhips length of them; and although I was ſo neer as about Musket-ſhot off, about half an hour together, not ſeeing a Man, ſtirring upon the upper Deck, I think it a great fault in a wiſe Vice-admiral, what ever it be thought of the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrancer:</hi> And although an Anchor was not let go, which was the duty of his place to have order'd, for ſo the Ship in all likelihood had been ſav'd. Nay, as there is good teſtimony, although I had heard, when my Lieutenant was on bord the <hi>Leopard,</hi> to tell him how effectually I recommended to him the coming forth; but they neglecting it, his Mate <hi>Wrighting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> whom he highly commended to me, I am ſure a man that knew when it was a fit ſeaſon for them to ſail, he was at their neglect ſo tranſported in paſſion, that he either ſtampt, or tore his hair, or uſed ſome ſuch geſture, ſaying, <hi>Theſe curſed men</hi> (meaning the Captains) <hi>are beſotted, or bewitched to this Mould; why cannot we go to Sea now we have ſo gallant an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and that the Admiral ſends for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, that neither in my Narrative, nor elſe how I ſhould cry up this mans faults, but rather take a garment to cover them, when as I ſay he was forward to come out, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by others, forbore it; yet after all, that a mans heart ſhould be ſo like a Forge, to blow up coals of Miſchief and Falſities on another (which are like to fall on himſelf) could
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135601:8"/>hardly have been imagined, but that Experience ſhews it.</p>
            <p>One word more of the Witneſſes, by many Letters that came to <hi>Porte Longone</hi> from Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> Conſul <hi>Read,</hi> and others, wherein was Complaints upon Complaints of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Seaman,</hi> and another. I ſay, whatſoever reports came from <hi>Legorn</hi> concerning their backwardneſs, or rather ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs to come out with others of their Neighbours under the ſame obligation with themſelves, as we uſe to ſay; he that hath but half an eye in his head, and one dram of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty in his heart, knowing what then paſt, as that there was but four ſhips of the Enemies in <hi>Legorn</hi> Road; and as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Appleton</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, the Enemie that fought us was ſhattered as much as we: if they had come to our Relief, we muſt have been (in humane appearance) in <hi>England</hi> with the Merchants great Cargazon long before the laſt yeer end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And yet I wrote not any thing to thoſe in Power or any others that I remember againſt theſe by name, that were the cauſe of ſo much loſs and damage as the Nation received thereby.</p>
            <p>Again, about the beginning of <hi>February</hi> laſt, ſeeing a ſtout gale of wind of the ſhore, it was much on my heart to go out at that time; and ſeeing but nine of the Enemies men of War in the Road, and there could be expected but two more in the Offing: A Councel of Officers being called, the Queſtion was carried from me, and anſwered in the Negative; and why Captain <hi>Seaman,</hi> ſaid he? it's the way to loſe three or four good ſhips, ſhewing cowardize enough I think. It was replyed, not ſo I trow; here is beſides others the <hi>Leopard,</hi> the <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> the <hi>Sampſon;</hi> and ſince I have gone to Sea, any one of theſe would not fear half a dozen, or the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe our Antagoniſts; but what ſaid Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> to me, you do but ſtrive againſt the Stream, in ſeeking to get out theſe Ships, they think they ſhall have their pay, and then it's no matter what ſervice they do; you muſt get Ships elſe-where to fetch them hence, if you will make any uſe of them; whereupon I wrote (upon that very ſcore) ſomewhat paſſionately unto the Councel of State among other matters, the enſuing paſſage.</p>

I do not in the leaſt doubt, but your Honors hath the Common wealths affairs in theſe parts under conſideration: Yet I beſeech you give me leave humbly to minde you, that ſome aſſiſtance (when leaſt) what is ſignified in former Letters, ſeems to be moſt neceſſarie, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Honour of our Nation, which is ſo much concerned in this Tranſaction, at ſuch a place eſpecially, which in ſome ſenſe may be called the Centre of Trade, upon which is the eye of all</hi> Europe: <hi>But it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported P.</hi> Rupert <hi>may be here every day with his prizes from the Weſt Indies, according to his own intimation by Letters; and if he comes before our conjunction, what diſorder our Marriners may be put into, cannot be fore-ſeen, beſides that other inconvenience.

            <p>And further; however I wrote not a word againſt this man, but when I came to ſpeak of the <hi>Sampſon</hi> in my Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, hid all his failings, ſaying; That the Ship being taken abackſtaies, the Enemy had opportunity to fire her: yet Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> (who I beleeve would write no ſuch thing without good proof) ſaith, it's no ſuch matter; The Captain and Company run under hatches, and did not look after trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Sails as they ſhould have done.</p>

Four dayes after, in <hi>Circa,</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten leagues from <hi>Zant,</hi> he tels me he had a mind to be gone for <hi>Smirna;</hi> but I anſwered, have a care what you do, leſt you looſe the ſhip your friends have intruſted you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, I muſt carry my buſineſs before me, in regard the <hi>Harry</hi> ſtops there: but I intend not to Anchor there, if the wind be fair. Well ſaith he, I will ſpeak with you again, yet did not, ſlipping away in the night. But though pragmaticall ſelf-conceitedneſs was judg'd a higher Tower then the Convoy, it was a thouſand to one it had not occaſioned his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and Owners to bid farewell to their Ship and Goods, for had not a ſtrong gale of wind brought him in after us to <hi>Zant,</hi> four <hi>Turks</hi> Men of War had call'd him to an account, This made me hint to the Committee of the Navy, how the Convoy was ſlighted, as it was by him unto the very laſt. But to ſee how things are carried by way of Retalio, he and others wel know, and the <hi>Levant</hi> Companies purſes hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vieſt feel.</p>
            <p>Yet being he had embraced the States Service afterwards, I advis'd him, no man ſhould be more willing to paſſe by prejudicatedneſſe of opinion againſt him, then my ſelf, as may appear by my Letters to him: However, after he had been in the ſervice of the State a few weeks, I ſent him an Order to go for <hi>Naples,</hi> or <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>na:</hi> yet he ſtayes, putting the State unto charge of ſome hundred pounds, which fault he laid on his men; and although I have heard the contrary, yet I winked at that time, and hitherto mentioned nothing of it.</p>
            <p>Next, in our Engagement at <hi>Legorn,</hi> ſuch was his failing, that I told him and others, at our very next meeting, after we came thence: Thoſe that had nimble ſhips were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too blame: But ſaid I, ſince we are home-ward bound, and I know not what eminent Service we may be call'd too for the Honour of the Nation, I will not cauſe contention now among you; but where ever there hath been a failing, let every man amend one next time, and one would have thought it would have wrought upon ingenious ſpirits.</p>
            <p>But after we came to the Bay of <hi>Legos,</hi> I ſent a Warrant
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135601:10"/>to him to ſpare two men, exchange of 2 <hi>Dutch</hi> men, to help man the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Prize, yet he abſolutely refuſed it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though earneſtly advis'd to the contrary by Captains, and others about him, that told him he could never anſwer it, yet peremptorily he denied it. Whereupon I bid the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and others about me to take notice; he and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort <hi>Fiſher,</hi> that made the like refuſal, were diſcharg'd out of the States ſervice, and that I would never give them any kind of order more, untill we came to the Generals, where their contempt ſhould be laid open, and I did forbear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of them a long time.</p>
            <p>But at length through perſwaſion of friends, and their own ſollicitations in publique and private, to forgive that one failing, what amendment ſhould I ſee, I was prevailed with all to lay aſide prejudice.</p>
            <p>Although I ſuppoſe by this time, that he very well knew that howbeit upon his own quarter Deck (as ſome prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall men in former times have done) he might cry, <hi>Am not I king now? am not I King now?</hi> Yet by the Laws Martial, which were either made to be put in Execution, or to be like Bug-bears which are to skare children, all the Councel he can find in <hi>England,</hi> can hardly ſave him from a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſentence for his contempt.</p>
            <p>Again, coming into the <hi>Downes,</hi> this Captain Ell comes to me in the Evening, deſiring he might have leave to go to <hi>Canterburie</hi> to meet his Wife; yea ſaid I, go, but pray be here ſpeedily, I know not what Orders may come from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor who ſuddenly may appear on the back of the <hi>Goodwin</hi> to engage us; In words he would comply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn accordingly; but was wanting thence ten dayes, and upward, as if (at leaſt) he were a Prince, not to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for any diſſervice to the State, which cauſed his men to mutiny, when his Ship was ordered to go to Sea. All this time I wrote nothing againſt him.</p>
            <p>Next they bring in one <hi>Whiting,</hi> that was heard ſay ſo, and ſo, it may be it is true as ſpoken from him; but I deny that I ever ſpake ſuch things, neither is there any reaſon or ſenſe for why I ſhould. But admit the latter had been true,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135601:10"/>it would have ſhewed ingratitude enough in him, a man whoſe life and freeedom I had firſt beg'd of the great Duke, and then at my requeſt his eſtate, and his worthy and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friends (by the rule of contraries) to the value of 3000 crowns, and the ſhip, all ſentenc'd for loſt, and confiſcated, were reprieved, remitted, and given back to them; at length being made Commander of the Fire-ſhip, his wretched cowardize in not proſecuting the work he was ſent about, with Main-ſaile and all: which had he done, having ſuch an opportunity as he had upon the <hi>Dutch Admiral,</hi> for ought I know it might have turn'd the day; and then the baſe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the next man to himſelf behind him, would have caus'd many a man to have brought him home in chains, and tryed him for his life; and if ſo, I know not what would have become of him.</p>
            <p>In fine, I have alwayes endeavour'd to govern with ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, mixt with ſome authority, and rather by multiplyed acts of Civility have laboured to engage them, then by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſneſſe to diſhearten them: and let whoſe will ſay to the contrary, I have been alwayes ready to cry up to the height in any ſervice of worth in them, and have covered all fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at the ſame time, as my Letters to Authority do witneſſe for me.</p>
            <p>But we ſee not only many of the Proverbs fulfill'd now and then, but old Stories. Waſh ſome creatures ears with never ſo much water, and they will be no whiter, heap coals of love on ſome, and they will turn back coals of fire on you, when it lies in their power, Traytor or any thing they wil not baulk at.</p>
            <p>But not to be tedious in rehearſing ingratitude, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> where I find Mr. <hi>Redding</hi> magnified in an employment he was ſent on by M. <hi>Longland,</hi> who with the deceaſed Captain <hi>Wood,</hi> is vilified to ſome purpoſe.</p>
            <p>A word of the former, of whom <hi>Ditto,</hi> Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me ſomething, as that Captain <hi>Appleton</hi> ſhould create him Agent, and that he went to <hi>Florence</hi> contrary to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and at the great Dukes Court he made Maſter <hi>Longland</hi> be look'd on as an Impoſtor, which forc'd him to ſend away
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135601:11"/>from <hi>Florence</hi> in the night for his Commiſſion. I alſo heard him ſay, that for ranting in <hi>Naples,</hi> wherein he and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany kill'd a Child, or for ſhooting at the Juſtice, he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd at the Bar on life and death; yet by crying out he was forc'd to fly from his Country in his Kings Cauſe, it fell out ſo, that he was ſav'd on a general day of grace, and ſet free with fellons, and murtherers: but as for ſervice for the Common wealth of <hi>England,</hi> I heard of none he did; yet if by a day of grace of greater advantage, his ſpirit is changed, that now he ſhal think of doing it in good earneſt, I ſhall be very glad.</p>
            <p>Next a word of Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> one of the abuſed perſons in charity I can do no leſſe then ſpeak out a word of my knowledg concerning him, and the dead: It's 16. yeers ſince I knew Mr: <hi>Longland</hi> firſt at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and as he then ſhewed himſelf as grave; ſober, diſcreet, and as religious a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant as ever I met withall abroard: So ever ſince the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament begun (oppoſe who would) as there wanted not Scoffers, and Oppoſers enough in thoſe parts, he would ſtill juſtifie the Parliaments proceedings, and the Armies, as by very many Letters of his appeareth altogether as freely and effectually before, as ſince he was the States ſervant: ſo that although they might have Friends abroad, I am confident they had no man like minded, that hath made it ſo much his ſtudy to advance the Benefit, and honour of the Nation, and good people in his reſtleſſe motions that way, and to rejoyce at their good ſucceſſe, as if he were to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more like a Stateſ-man, then a Merchant; and he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the imputation of ſuch a wicked wretch, as would betray the States Captains into Priſon, and ſend away a Poſt into <hi>England</hi> to complain of the <hi>Remonſtrancer;</hi> and then for Captain <hi>Appleton</hi> to ſay the deceaſed Cap: <hi>Wood</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over him, I dare ſay is a moſt falſe thing, in that there are many can teſtifie he was a man reſtleſſe to ſerve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captains in their neceſſities (who had ſhewed them ſelves his great enemies) in ſo high a nature, as that the like can hardly be parallel'd, and ſo much I can further ſay for the ſaid Captain, according to what Mr: <hi>Longland</hi> denotes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135601:11"/>(as his opinion) in his Letter to me at my firſt coming into <hi>Porto Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,</hi> he was a man more readier to ſerve the State, then ſuch as eat their bread, before ever he entred into the States ſervice to receive their pay, not only in taking care to haſten Ammunition, and other things to me at my firſt harbouring in <hi>Longone,</hi> but otherwiſe. And if Captain <hi>Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and Captain <hi>Seaman,</hi> the letter of which ſtruck him as I have heard, for expreſſing his zeal to the States Affairs; I ſay, had they hearkned to his counſel, or thoſe keen Arguments he us'd to draw them forth to my aſſiſtance in <hi>Porto Longone;</hi> at my firſt coming there, we had been in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> long ſince; and all along to his death, he was a faithful, ſtout ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, and one that to his laſt breath would acknowledg their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was of themſelves, they did not follow Order, and went out too ſoon in the morning, being they went not in the night.</p>
            <p>But again to the <hi>Remonſtrance:</hi> Whereas he ſaith, that he ſtir'd about taking the <hi>Phaenix</hi> Frigot by my order, if I forget not, that will prove very falſe, becauſe he had hindred it once before, and ſo I was minded to make no further uſe of him in that buſineſſe, yet I do not deny, but that (without giving diſturbance to the Dukes Port) I ordered that ſhe ſhould be ſtollen away from the drunken <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to that purpoſe I picked out (at was Capt: <hi>Cox</hi> his deſire) ſome chief perſons: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving encouraged them all that lay in my power, I ſent them away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and at the time it might have taken place, I went on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to ſee her ſteal away, at my return being certainly inform'd how it had taken effect, to the joy of my heart, being confident it was as good a piece of ſervice as could be done the Nation at that time: And ſo the Councel of <hi>State</hi> eſteemed it, when they were pleas'd to give Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> and my ſelf thanks for it: And truly if ſuch ſervice meet with no kind of eſteem, ſuch an ill Conſequence may follow, as that thoſe that eat the States bread, will turn as very Drones as their hearts can deſire, who are on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>And Cap. <hi>Appleton</hi> well knoweth; if not, I am ſure I have heard, at firſt the great Duke commended the Exploit, ſaying the Turks had ſtole her away from the drunken Flemmings, whilſt they minded their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe no better, and all ſeemed to be covered, ſo that in many dayes after, the Duke ſent me not a word about it; and it's judg'd (by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men) he would never have taken notice of it as a diſturbance to his Port; had not that fooliſh childiſh act of Captain <hi>Appletons</hi> in taking the <hi>Dutch</hi> man out of his Centinels houſe, with his own hand (as if he had been Lord Paramount in that Countrey) highly incens'd him, as indeed it would any other Prince, or State in the like Caſe.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135601:12"/>And when the great Duke did diſpatch away a Meſſenger to me to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that high affront in his firſt Letter, as one in whom the thoughts about the <hi>Phaenix</hi> Frigot were utterly extinct, and drownd, he mentions not a word to me of that buſineſs, until his ſecond Letter came long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then I could do leſſe then own it, and labour to juſtifie it, as I can do now more fully.</p>
            <p>And I could wiſh alſo, that Authority had been pleaſed to have done it more effectually in their Anſwer, and not leave Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> and my ſelf (their Servants) in ſome kind of difficulty, or ſhame upon us about it. For I fear it opened a gap to ſome further trouble.</p>
            <p>Now to prove that the ſaid Act was no diſturbance or affront to his Port (or at leaſt) ought not to have been eſteemed ſo without great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, it is clearly thus, againſt which (I believe) there can be no rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Objection.</p>
            <p>Some weeks before the <hi>Phaenix</hi> was ſurprized, a ſmal <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip bound for <hi>Barbary,</hi> comes out of the <hi>Mould,</hi> and was ſhot at by the <hi>Dutch</hi> men of War, with divers ſhot, and they afterwards chas'd her; now if the great Duke accounted that no diſturbance, ſo as to make a publick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, by impriſoning the Captains, denying them proviſions, or by ſending an extraordinary Meſſenger into <hi>Holland.</hi> Then he ought not to account Capt. <hi>Cox</hi> ſlipping away with the Frigot (after the drunken fit of the <hi>Dutch</hi> was over) in ſuch a manner as that the veſſel (being far without ſhot of his Cannons, when the attempt was made) did get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and yet not diſcerned by his people from the ſhore, to be any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, or diſturbance at all to his Port.</p>
            <p>But if it be objected here, they did the Duke ſervice therein, in regard it was contrary to his Laws that a Ship ſhould carry <hi>Lead</hi> to <hi>Barbary:</hi> I anſwer, they might have acquainted him with it while ſhe was in his <hi>Cubert,</hi> or in the <hi>Mould,</hi> and not let him know of it afterwards by the ratling of their ſhot. And thus I have anſwered the <hi>Remonſtrancer</hi> in that particular, wherein peradventure he hop'd I would have come under the Laſh of Juſtice for breach of Orders; but he is not ſo ſecret in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plots of his malice, but it may be as openly diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Again, the next thing mentioned at his coming to <hi>Legorn</hi> the laſt time is, That the Dukes Secretary, my ſelf, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> had concluded to Fight; A pretty ſtory, that made me ſmile, though malice enough lye under theſe ſinders; but as cunningly as the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> is dreſt up, the knots about it are not ſo tied, but a little skill and honeſty is able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do them all, and make the filthineſs that is underneath, to be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered. I know there was a Treaty, if you will have it call'd ſo,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135601:12"/>between the Dukes Secretary, Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> and my ſelf, as there was it may be the ſame between the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and that Secretary, but to ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us three was a Treaty, is a horridfalſity, or much leſs, that it was concluded amongſt us to Fight the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and yet the ſearcher of hearts muſt be appealed unto in this thing, amongſt other falſities, as if they were very truth; Great impiety, and God may be a ſwifter witneſs againſt falſe Swearers, then they are aware of.</p>
            <p>One would wonder to ſee how the Great Dukes failings ſhould all be covered by Cap. <hi>Appleton,</hi> whoſe name he could not mention, except with a ſcorn, but that we know by an old practice, Two arch enemies wil make friends to bring about their ends upon thoſe that are faithful</p>
            <p>There's not a man or Boy in the Fleet, but muſt needs take notice, that the Great Duke thruſt us out of his Port, and that after all means had been uſed for the gaining of thirty days time, until our <hi>Venice</hi> ſhips that had coſt the State of <hi>England</hi> ſo vaſt an Expence, came up to our Aſſiſtance, inſomuch that Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> and my ſelf, proffered the Great Dukes Secretary as much money as the <hi>Phaenix</hi> Frigot was worth, to give the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or do what he would withall, and although he knows thereupon, what a Speech I made in the face of each Ships Company, ſaying, our condition was much like thoſe <hi>Leapers</hi> we read of: The Great Duke commanded us to be gone hence in ten dayes time, and if not, here are more Guns brought down (for ought I could perceive) to expiate our Deſtruction; ſo that if we ſtay any longer we muſt periſh, and if we go forth, we can do no more; wherefore as Gods providence had put us on ſuch neceſſitous ſervice, ſo I hop'd our ſins ſhould not hinder his High appearance with us in it; &amp; the riſe I had from thence, to ſtir them up to quit themſelves like Engliſhmen, was not unknown. And though he very well knoweth in the ſteerage of every ſhip it was paſted up, to this effect, That whereas the Great Dake had required us to go thence in ſo ſhort a time, each individual man, as wel Captains as others, were therefore required to give their attendance to their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective Shipt, and not to go thence on ſhoar upon any terms, without ſpeciall leave, as they would anſwer the contrary at their perils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And moreover, though he very well knew the Duke had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to procure our Conjunction (or at leaſt) to have caus'd our Enemy to have gone out, and Fought us in the Sea, yet ſlighted it, &amp; at length ſet at liberty the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains, and many of their Marriners, which he had in Priſon, &amp; though our Ships were taken very near the <hi>Mould</hi> head, ſhoots not a ſhot in their defence; yet notwithſtanding all this, Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> takes no notice of it, as if he would Petition him for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:135601:13"/>money back again, which he ſaith it coſt him formerly to procure his pardon.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſome wil ſay (as I have heard they have already) the Great Duke is a Worthy and Magnificent Prince, and wrote you, that the ſhips might ſtay longer in his <hi>Mould,</hi> if there was a neceſſity for it.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: Truth is, untill we had a loſs here in <hi>England</hi> of the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other ſhips, I had very good reſpect from him, (and I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with as much reverence, reſpectiveneſs, and thankfulneſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſame) and he told me he was not my Friend ſo much becauſe I was in an eminent Employment for the State, but upon an old ſcore, I might Command him, yet the News of a fore-mentioned loſs turned the ſtreame preſently; for like Politicians they took the ſtrongeſt ſide, and then I could no more be heard in what was but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and reaſon, then if thoſe words had never come out of his mouth. <hi>I</hi> very wel know what was wrote in anſwer to mine, about the latter end of <hi>Feb:</hi> laſt, <hi>I</hi> deſired when winds and weather hindred my coming to <hi>Legorn</hi> (within the time limited) it might be lookt upon as a juſt impediment. The Anſwer runs thus, <hi>You ſhall have eight days added to the former, and longer if neceſſity required.</hi> What neceſſity is that, but the being croſt by winds and weather: for all men know, vvho uſe thoſe parts, that the Northerly wind bloweth ſometimes ſo freſh, that a man may be put to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſo that in eight days he cannot get up to <hi>Legorn</hi>-Road. If he had meant other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that knew how importunate I was, But for thirty days time, would have ſaid, take the time you deſire, then ſhould I have known what to have done. If yet any will make a more favourable conſtruction of his words, I ſhall only ſay thus much, I wiſh he may find what I have oft times thought on, to be a true ſaying, <hi>One ounce of reall honeſty and integrity, will turn better to account in all caſes, then a whole pound of Court policy, where mentall reſervations are uſed, by which they will have liberty to make two ſeverall Conſtructions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this crying up of magnificency, I know not what to make of it, except there be ſuch abroad as differ in judgement from ſome Atheiſtical ſpirits, I have met withal in the parts, where I have been, both of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> who have held, that in ſo many hundred thouſand yeers (I forgot the juſt number, there ſhal be a Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of all things, as if I ſhould be a writing, and you ſhould be a reading, juſt as we are now, I ſay peradventure ſome men may be of the mind, the Revolution may come about ſooner.</p>
            <p>In fine, Let others judge of that Tranſaction what they will, I am of opinion, that the blood of the men of our Nation which fell that day, will lye (in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) at the Great Dukes door.</p>
            <p>But to the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> in anſwer to my charge of Treachery or Cowardiſe, or they know not what themſelves, I ſuppoſe the proofs that are herein included will acquit me of the former, and if thoſe, (who very well know <hi>I</hi> have complained of them as great failers in ſervice) do not acquit me of the latter, let me lye under that indignity. <hi>I</hi> ever counted it one of the unhandſomeſt things in the world, to be ſpeaking out any thing tending to ſelf applauſe; yet <hi>I</hi> am in a manner conſtrained to write like ſuch a one at this time, although my aim is that God alone may have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by it.</p>
            <p>The 29 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1652 it fell out that more then the ſeven eight parts of our ſhips Company mutinied
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:135601:13"/>againſt me (notwithſtanding about midnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every individuall man in the Ship, who was not wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, gave me his hand to live and dye with me if occaſion were, againſt the enemy next day) but then got on their beſt cloaths, or one way or another declared themſelves, by making the Ship uncapable of ſteerage, or otherwiſe, that they would leave the Ship <hi>Paragon,</hi> and the rich Merchants Ships to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; nay, ſo high was the mutiny, that ſome gave out they would deſtroy my perſon, if I would not give them leave to call for quarter, in caſe the enemy had come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And when I had made a ſpeech among them, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them what in me lay (although now ſo ſpent, that it was a very great paine to me to ſpeake ſo as to be heard twice or thrice my length) notwithſtanding ſome Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders came after me, where I was heaving over bord the lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our men had got up to cloy our Guns, and told me, I ſtrove againſt the ſtreame, and thoſe very men that held up their hands before to ſtand by me, had declared they would call for Quarter among the reſt, when ever the Enemy came neere; and upon that ſcore begg'd of me to looſe no more time, but forſake the Ship, and give them leave to fire their Merchants ſhips with rich Goods, and flye alſo: But my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them was to this effect: As it is ſaid, was given to Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi> in another caſe, <hi>I will not give you ſuch leave as you deſire, but if you will begin upon your owne account, doe it;</hi> I can fire our Ship when the Enemy comes within Musket ſhot. And adding, <hi>Be but patient, and waite upon God a little, and I am perſwaded God will ſave this part of</hi> Englands <hi>ſtrength and wealth, whether men will or no;</hi> and ſo it ſell out through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in cauſing it to fall flat calme; of which miraculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation (if ſome Merchants were rightly ſenſible) they would not murmur, and quarrel, and be ready to ſpeake all manner of evil, whether right or wrong, againſt the States faithfull Servants. It's feared, becauſe really and truly they are ſuch, although the pretence be otherwiſe, and yet as far peradventure as the former from Chriſtianity; Oh the event and ſucceſſe hath not anſwered the great deſires of gaine that was on their hearts, being the Goods were left by the way, &amp; not brought through.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:135601:14"/>
            <p>But for the Service before mentioned, the Councel of State by Order of Parliament, ſent me a Letter of Thanks, wherein they did no more declare how well they reſented my weak endeavours, and how it ſhould be advantagious to me at my returne (which includes kind Acceptance, the moſt I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired after) then I with all reverence and thankfulneſſe did acknowledge.</p>
            <p>But peradventure ſome will ſay, What need all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning what paſt in your firſt Engagement? You are not blamed for Cowardiſe then; it's thought, according to what was reported and openly ſaid on the <hi>Exchange,</hi> when as this Remonſtrancers Letters came for <hi>England,</hi> with ſome other Letters from (Malignant) Merchants, ſuch as would be gladder that the Dutch, then that the Engliſh ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, and no other, <hi>Badiley was turn'd Coward, Badiley was turn'd Coward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When all things that have been ſaid in the foregoing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and ſhall yet be declared, be weighed in the ballance of Truth, and be found downe weight, not having a tittle of fallaciouſneſſe in them; and when the Teſtimony is likewiſe conſidered, I believe there is hardly ever an honeſt man in <hi>England,</hi> but will confeſſe with altogether as much honeſty, they might have cryed out, and ſaid, <hi>Badiley was turn'd Turke, Badiley was turn'd Turke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But naught ſaith (I ſhould ſay naughty people) he had <hi>Currants,</hi> and I know not what in his Fleet, and for private advantage ſake turn'd his back upon the Enemy: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that hath been declared to the Committee of the Admiralty, and it can be fully proved that for ought I could know, my loſſe in the <hi>Perrigreene</hi> (for want of timely ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour) was more then I had in our part of the Fleet, that came away, although the ſhirt on my back had been priz'd at the higheſt value, but if there were ſome ſmall difference, that were a likely matter indeed, ſithence that it now appeareth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commiſſioners of the Navy. In zeale to the States Service, and it cannot be imagined to any other end, at <hi>Porto Ferraro,</hi> I run out of my owne particular ſtock, to the value of 1000 l. in <hi>Circa,</hi> which I believe the State will make me good hereafter.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:135601:14"/>
            <p>I ſhall now come to ravell out the later end of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance</hi> into ſome parts, and ſo anſwer them.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Appleton</hi> ſaith in one place (that after I was gone for <hi>Porte Ferraro</hi>) I ſent him order to haſten to mee as ſoone as the <hi>Dutch</hi> weighed Anchor, and upon his life to do it with all diligence; and a little below he ſaith, without Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> he durſt not act, my order being to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Elihu</hi> well ſaid; <hi>Juſt as the mouth doth taſt meate, ſo the eares of wiſe men tryeth words:</hi> To whom I appeale, whether there be not Non-ſenſe, or Contradiction enough in that part.</p>
            <p>For he that looketh in the Letter, wherein I advis'd him to haſten after, as for life when as the <hi>Dutch</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, that we might not be too much over-preſt before they came for our aſſiſtance, ſhall not finde that I there or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him (however) he ſhould not act any thing without Mr. <hi>Longlands</hi> preſence and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſuch an Order muſt be either before, or after that Letter was ſent him; if he ſaith it were before, then this Letter makes it of none effect; but if he ſaith it were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it made the former order null, and void.</p>
            <p>Whether it were before or after, certainely no knowing man will imagine, that by my <hi>Letters,</hi> or Orders, I ſhut out my owne Authority, ſo as to ſay, although I come there my ſelfe in perſon, yet you are to act nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Maſter <hi>Longland:</hi> and if this be beleev'd, I would not part with the Command I had over that Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron.</p>
            <p>Then thus it will follow: Why did not hee and the reſt come out when I ſent for them (as it were in perſon) by my Lieutenant? And if my former order of haſtning as for life were in his eye, why then did he not haſten as for life? For if ſo, in all likelihood we had got together, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Victory over our Enemies.</p>
            <p>If yet he ſaith, Mr. <hi>Longlands</hi> opinion was to be taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtir'd next morning, why did he not conform to his Counſell (for what ever they ſay in their <hi>Remonſtrance</hi>) it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:135601:15"/>will be prov'd by what Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> hath wrote to the Councell of State, Committee of the Admiralty, and my ſelfe about that Buſineſs, is a reall truth.</p>
            <p>When he ſaw they would go out ſo ſoon, contrary to his Advice, he ſhut himſelfe in his Chamber, giving up all for loſt; and as it's prov'd, when Cap. <hi>Wood</hi> came aſhore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, oh ſaith he (as he confeſs'd to his laſt breath) Maſter <hi>Longland, Our Deſtruction is of our ſelves, our Deſtruction is of our ſelves, we cannot blame Captaine</hi> Badiley, <hi>nor any body elſe, ſince we went not out in the night when as we were ſent for, I ſaw wee went too ſoone in the morning; if we had ſtaid while the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall had been engag'd, all might have been well enough,</hi> or words to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Truth is, I did write him ſuch a Letter as he mentions, wherein he was ordered to haſten after me as for life, in caſe the Enemie came to looke after me in the Sea, and I did it for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe all men had complained of his dulneſſe and backwardneſſe in coming to our aſſiſtance the time that wee were formerly engag'd.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, in regard that I had ſent ſome Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the great Duke, humbly begging him to endeavour the <hi>Dutch</hi> might comply, and not fight our Ships under his Cannons, but come out to Sea, and do it there.</p>
            <p>Now who could imagine, that hee that had made ſuch a deale of pudder, complaining of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commanders in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> high manner about violating his Port, would not have conſtrained the <hi>Dutch,</hi> if they would have fought us, to come out and fight at Sea, and upon that ſcore did I verily believe they would have been with me, either at <hi>Porte Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raro,</hi> or as ſoone as ever I came thence; much leſſe could we imagine, that ever the Duke would turn all the Dutch Captains, and others of that Nation that had affronted him out of Priſon, and unworthily ſuffered ſome of our Ships to be taken within Musket-ſhot of his Works, and not ſhoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a ſhot in our defence.</p>
            <p>And it is as true as the former, that after that Letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned (upon other news I did adviſe) that in my
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135601:15"/>abſence I would have them conſult with Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> about the time of their coming out: but they that run may read, and clearly ſee, that Cap. <hi>Appleton</hi> hath neither conform'd to my Order and Advice, in coming out in the night, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch a fit opportunity, which made the Maſters Mate, or Pylot ſay, they were curſed people to be ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched to that Mould, as not to goe when their Admirall ſent for them; neither hath he conform'd to Mr. <hi>Longlands</hi> advice, which was; that ſince they did not goe in the night, they ſhould not goe out ſo ſoon as they did, but ſtay whilſt I was engaged with the Enemie before they went out.</p>
            <p>But Cap. <hi>Appleton</hi> doth not confeſſe in ſo many words, that my Lieutenant came to call him away in the night; however, beſides the teſtimony given in, ſuch jugling is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by his owne expreſſions; he ſaith he had thoughts of coming out, but that the wind faltered; now, how came he by ſuch thoughts? either they were from mee, or from Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> but they were not from Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that the want of his Order was an impediment.</p>
            <p>But what ſaith he? Cap. <hi>Badiley</hi> ſent to ſee in what readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we were in, and to tell me the <hi>Conſtant Warwick</hi> would be ſent neer the Mould head in the morning to aſſiſt us, with the Fire-ſhip.</p>
            <p>Cap. <hi>Appleton</hi> well knoweth I ſaw the Ships all clear, and ready to engage at a quarter of an hours warning before I left the place of <hi>Legorn,</hi> which was about eight or ten dayes before: and beſides, by Cap. <hi>Appletons</hi> owne Letters, and by Cap. <hi>Coxe</hi> that was in with them the night before, I heard they were in a readineſſe: ſo that now to ſend my Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at midnight through the Enemies Boats, or Scouts that lay in wait for ours, it had been as vain a thing in me as in him, to make ſuch a lame excuſe.</p>
            <p>But he addes, the Meſſenger told him that the <hi>Conſtant Warwicke,</hi> and the Fire-ſhip ſhould be at the Mould head in the morning to receive him forth: were it not now an eaſie thing to condemn him out of his own mouth, and ſay, why went you out of the Mould ſo ſoone in the morning (being you went not in the night) ſince you had word ſent, the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135601:16"/>
               <hi>Conſtant Warwicke</hi> and the Fire-ſhip ſhould be at the Mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to receive you, and in effect intimating, that untill then you were not to come forth: For as ſoone as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to looſe Saile in the Mould, I was heard ſay, <hi>ſurely they will not be ſo mad as to come forth before the Conſtant Warwicke and others be neere the Mould-head to receive them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed; he ſaith when he firſt engag'd, Cap. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diley</hi> and his Fleet might have come to us quarter winds, if they would: To that I ſhall only ſay thus much, let me lie under the cenſure and diſ-reputation about it, if I cannot prove by ſome hundred Witneſſes, <hi>that as the winde gave leave, ſo we plyed in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I make no queſtion, but as many Witneſſes can make it clearly appear, no time was loſt after their coming out of the Mould, but all diligence was uſed to haſten in to their ſuccour, and many of the <hi>Parragons</hi> men can averre, they never ſee me more earneſt then I was at that time, in looking after the Sailes and Steerage, and in labouring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout hoyſing the Top-gallant Sailes ſo long, untill it was fear'd all would have come downe about our eares; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gave the Ship Brace and Sheat as the wind would give leave, and ſlackned no other Saile untill we came within ſhot, and then haled up our Main-ſaile (as was all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world) being the Capſtain that heaves our tacks aboard in thoſe Ships would have hindered the uſe of foure Guns, beſides other inconveniences that might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Next he ſaith, at laſt we came within halfe ſhot, as if we had loſt time before (an eaſie underſtanding can trace the malice that runs through his expreſſions) I have given the Councell of State already an Account what I did when I came neere, as that I went directly with the Admirall of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> preparing to grapple with her; but caſting my eye about, and feeing none of our Frigots had executed my Orders about relieving the <hi>Leopard,</hi> conſidering ſhee was worth three of the Dutch Admirall, I powred about thirty pieces of Ordnance, and a volley of ſmall ſhot into her, and ſtood away for the <hi>Leopard,</hi> with a reall intent to have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:135601:16"/>gone on Bord thoſe were on bord her, but it was judg'd no wiſdome to run ſtemlings on bord with all Saile, being a freſh gale of winde when we firſt came neere her: And paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi> ſtern within two or three ſhips lengths from her at moſt; and within halfe Musket-ſhot of the <hi>Leopards</hi> ſtern, it may be that is halfe ſhots length, Cap. <hi>Appleton</hi> ſpeaks of, having diſcharged firſt a broad ſide, and a volley of ſmall ſhot, on that ſhip, and the <hi>Sunne,</hi> in hopes to have cut one Maſt or another by the bord, we made way to flat our Ship round, fully intending to have gone on bord with our fore-ſaile hal'd up either between the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and the <hi>Julius Ceſar,</hi> (and ſo ſhould have been able to have fenc'd on both ſides) or elſe to have lain alongſt the <hi>Sunnes</hi> ſide, with my Bow-ſprit over the <hi>Leopards</hi> Poop: but it pleaſed God the wind ſo dullard all on a ſuddain, that our Ship with as much endeavour as ever was us'd, would not weare nor beare up, ſo that wee were forc'd to bring our Ship to, and ſtand further, before we could make her ſtay; and when we had got her about, we ſtood away for the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſars</hi> ſide again, reſolving to get on bord that time; and having paſs'd another broad ſide on her about Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot off, the Helm was put a weather to beare up againe, but the Ship we could not make work with that little wind, if a thouſand Common-wealths had lain upon it: And the ſight of it tranſporting me into a paſſion, I call'd to my Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to paſſe the word among the nimble Ships, that I would have them goe on board the <hi>Leopard,</hi> or thoſe Ships on bord her to ſee to diſ-intangle her from thoſe Ships: Whereupon having none within call but the <hi>Mary Roſe,</hi> he call'd to her to go on bord; but they being no better man'd excus'd it; thereupon I ſtept up to look for the <hi>Lewis,</hi> with words in mouth to this effect; <hi>Where is this vapouring flaſh</hi> Ell <hi>now, with his forty men, and his</hi> 20. <hi>Guns, or his thirty Guns and his fourſcore men? where is hee? ſee if you can make him hear, that we may employ him in this ſervice?</hi> but he was gone out of call after his owne inventions. In all this time there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appears not a man upon the <hi>Leopards</hi> upper Deck that I could diſcern: and being extreamly troubled to ſee the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:135601:17"/>manag'd no better, I call'd to man the Pinace, and the Lord my great witneſſe knoweth, with a full reſolution to have gone on board her with my boat, when I could not with the ſhip, verily believing the Captain had been kil'd, and chiefe Officers, and had kept my reſolution.</p>
            <p>But although Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> now ſaith the two Ships on bord him call'd for quarter, or he knoweth not for what; thoſe Ships untill I was gone fir'd five times as many Guns as the <hi>Leopard</hi> did in my ſight; for I never ſaw her ſhoot but once in halfe an hours time: I ſay the with-drawing of the <hi>Leopards</hi> men within doors and hatches, and their not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to let goe an Anchor in any time, nor doing any thing elſe towards their owne preſervation, caus'd me to think ſome part of the <hi>Leopard</hi> might be in the Enemies poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and ſo was diverted from going in my Boat.</p>
            <p>But Captain <hi>Appleton</hi> ſaith, his men call'd to the <hi>Conſtant Warwicke,</hi> to tell them the Enemies cal'd for Quarter, and therefore they ſhould forbeare firing on thoſe that lay on bord her. As for the Frigots Commander, let him anſwer for it, that hee did not acquaint me with what he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of from the <hi>Leopard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if I had been in Cap. <hi>Appletons</hi> place, and expreſt ſo much as now he doth, truly I ſhould have fear'd I ſhould have been accounted one of the greateſt Cowards, or fools in the world; for if the men did call for quarter, which I believe is as true, or as falſe as many other things mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Libell, or <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> then why did he not call his men upon the Deck to enter them, (at leaſt) why did not he himſelfe appeare on the Poope, when his Admirall came by, and have told him ſo much: Or if his with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were through feare, why was not ſome body elſe ſent on the Poope to have done it, and have ſhook his hat, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>All is ours, all is ours.</hi> I but ſaith he, to colour the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (as if we were all aſleep in the Fleet beſides) by a ſtory he tells in his <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> (in point of truth, like that of 600 Crowns agreed on at a Councell of Warre to be given for his re-eſtabliſhment) how that 5 of the Enemies ſhips ſo gal'd him, that he was not able to poſſeſſe them that cal'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:135601:17"/>for quarter. If it be not a dreame, I am ſure they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, above two hundred perſons beſide my ſelfe will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the contrary; none was neere within Saker ſhot, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were within ſhot of their beſt Ordnance, but only the Admirall of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that made what meanes he could with his <hi>Sprit-ſaile,</hi> and <hi>Sprit-ſaile top ſaile</hi> to get away; and being twice Musket-ſhot from him, diſcharg'd no Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon him that I and others could diſcern: and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will be very hard to prove by the teſtimony of any honeſt man, that ever they were ſtruck with a ſhot from any Ship of the Enemie while we were neere, but only from them two on bord the <hi>Leopard:</hi> Now then except his ſhip had been ſhot-free between Decks, ſince no man can aver any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie was neer but thoſe on bord, or had been within Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot of him, his men would have been as ſecure on the upper deck, as on the lower, &amp; they might have bin as ſafe all the time they were entring the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhips, he ſaith cal'd for Quarter, as to have ſtaid in their own; and therefore I know not what to make of that paſſage, it ſhows ſo like a frenzy Fiction.</p>
            <p>Next, Cap. <hi>Appleton</hi> magnifies the valour of Cap. <hi>Ell,</hi> and Cap. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> telling how they did aſſiſt, as if no body elſe did; and again he declares, Cap. <hi>Ell</hi> did great execution on the Enemy. This is juſt the old proverb, <hi>Claw me, and I'le claw thee:</hi> But you have ſufficient Witneſſes given in alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and I dare ſay there may be found above a hundred more to atteſt thoſe that did leaſt ſervice in reference to the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards</hi> reliefe, did as much ſervice, or rather more then was done by the <hi>Lewis</hi> or <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next Cap. <hi>Appleton</hi> ſaith I cal'd off the <hi>Lewis</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> that would have aſſiſted him, and ſet my Main-ſaile to goe away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer; When I ſaw all hopes paſt, in humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not becauſe the Enemie was now grown three to one, there being foure of our beſt Ships loſt before I could come up, and one ſince, nor becauſe many more expected from Eaſt and Weſt every houre to their aſſiſtance, but none to ours; Although I believe it's juſtifiable for a Commander in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:135601:18"/>Chieſe to with-draw in ſuch a caſe, or elſe old <hi>Van Trumpe</hi> had been in a poore condition, when as twice together, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the numbers were upon the matter equall, he let us take away ſo many ſhips, and ſtaid not by it, but with-drew with the reſt.</p>
            <p>Neither was the <hi>Leopard</hi> left in that Caſe (whether ſunck or afloat we could not tell) in regard moſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of our nimble Ships had acted quite contrary to order in this (as they did in my laſt) engagement, which yet is a ſad, and heart-diſcouraging miſchief.</p>
            <p>And although I had of my ſelfe no inclination to leave the place, as I did, yet when halfe a ſcore of the Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the <hi>Paragon</hi> came, and gave me it, as an opinion they would juſtifie upon their lives, ſaying to this effect: Sir, if now you goe on bord the <hi>Leopard,</hi> and thoſe with her, to relieve the former, we cannot ſee how it's poſſible you can diſ-intangle your ſelfe againe before both ſhips be aſhore; beſides ſaith many, it's very queſtionable whether ſhe be not ſunck already, and ly on the ground. Hence it was, I ſet my Main-ſaile, and came away; and if he looks on that, to be the ſign of calling off the Fleet, Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> is in the right; but if his meaning be according to the litterall ſenſe of his Expreſſions, how that I cal'd to Cap. <hi>Ell</hi> and Captain <hi>Fiſher</hi> to come away, when as they were going to relieve the <hi>Leopard,</hi> by ſufficient Teſtimonie, it will be prov'd a moſt falſe thing.</p>
            <p>I know not upon what other ſcore the <hi>Machiavelian</hi> poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie (except it be to tickle the minds of ſome of their Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) they ſhould appeare againſt mee, who before ſundry upon the <hi>Parragons</hi> decks, and in her Round-houſe, as hath all other Captains ſaid in our paſſage home-ward; in caſe the Admirall had gone on bord the <hi>Leopard,</hi> or thoſe Ships lay entangled with her, in all likelihood the whole Fleet except the Frigots (who could have fled) had been loſt: And now we come to the ſtreſſe of all, what Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> ſaith of Cap. <hi>Ell</hi> and Cap. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and they ſay of themſelves the <hi>Leopard</hi> had been relieved, but that I hindred them.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:135601:18"/>
            <p>I know not what to make of ſuch impudency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency, I profeſſe were I in their caſe, my owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would tell me, that although other contempts were pardoned, which the Law Martial ſaith is Death, I deſerved the ſevereſt ſentence for coming ſhort of my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not complying with the Admirals Order, in point of the <hi>Leopards</hi> reliefe: But a word more.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for Capt. <hi>Ell,</hi> before we came neere the <hi>Leopard,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Rear-Admirall aground, whereas all the Frigots had ſpeciall order to relieve any who were oppreſt by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſeeing they did not act accordingly, as I was haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in to the <hi>Leopards</hi> reliefe, being he was neere me, either I call'd to him, or did expect although he were of the Rear-Admirals Squadron, he ſhould follow me, and keep near me in my Weather-quarter, where then he was, his Leader being aground: for knowing that the <hi>Lewis</hi> was almoſt double man'd, in proportion to other Merchants Ships, I thought to have her by me to employ upon ſome eminent ſervice, when as there ſhould be occaſion, but whil'ſt we were endeavouring to bear up, and goe on board the <hi>Leopard,</hi> he goeth after his owne inventions, ſo that when our Ship would not work (it being little wind, and our Ship heavy and foule) I bid call to the <hi>Lewis</hi> to bear up, and go on bord the <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> and ſeeing ſhe was gone out of call, and that the <hi>Mary Roſe</hi> had made her excuſe for want of men, I confeſſe I was almoſt diſtracted with paſſion, ſaying (amongſt other things in my mind) to this effect, <hi>When ſuch vapouring Blades are in a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomans Chamber, oh then they are mighty men of valour; but now here is ſervice to be done, they can turne ſhifters above all that ever any Commander in chiefe was troubled withall, before me.</hi> Yet as he lay in my way as we were withdrawing, when we ſaw it was too late to doe any more then what was done, <hi>I</hi> might bid him follow me.</p>
            <p>As for Capt. <hi>Fiſher</hi> thus, knowing there was ſuch pittifull Captaines to be employed with me in this ſervice, that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture would forget in the morning, what they did over night; I ſent a Copy of what was agreed on at our Councel
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:135601:19"/>of War, to Capt. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> wherein among other Orders it was agreed as followes.</p>
            <p>If any of the Admirals, Vice-Admirals, or Rear-Admirals Squadron, were laid on bord by the enemy, then ſuch as were next to them of that Squadron, ought to have laid any ſuch Ship of the Enemies on bord againe on the other ſide. But now pray mark, not to tell you how peremptorily he hath refuſed my Warrant or Command, before or afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in ſome kind elſewhere, ſee how he layes himſelfe open under the laſh of the higheſt cenſure, or ſevereſt ſentence, take but his owne words, <hi>He broke through the Dutch Fleet, and then did very good ſervice a ſecond time,</hi> meaning he made a bord or two near the <hi>Leopard,</hi> I ſay in that he did not goe on bord the <hi>Leopard</hi> according to the Order of the Councel of VVar, he being of that Squadron, the Vice-Admirals Squadron, what hath this man to ſay, but that truly he is not ſuch a novice in <hi>Matchiavels</hi> Arts, nor yet ſuch a ſottiſh perſon as ſome of his men complained to me of, when as they mutined in the <hi>Downes;</hi> nor yet ſuch a reputed Coward, which made me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any one might Command that Ship rather then he, and ſure enough he had never been in that place, but that Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> advis'd me the owners earneſtly deſired it, and for quietneſſe ſake it were beſt I yielded. But I ſay, he knows well enough (it's ſaid being well backt) how to abuſe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, in hope that (right or wrong) ſomething may ſtick to his diſparagement.</p>
            <p>But in the cloſe, Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> declares how the Marriners wreſted his ſword out of his hand, and put his arm and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of joynt; whether that were true as that the Ships on bord him cal'd for Quarter, ſome of his chief Officers are not able to tel, for though they ſaw C. <hi>Appleton</hi> the day they were ſurprized, yet heard nothing of any ſuch thing, but however it ſeems he was able to hold it before, then one would think I ſhould have ſeen it, or himſelfe at leaſt (in his place) on the Poop, all the time I was neer him, ſo long together. After that comes in a ſtory of the Gunners order to blow up the Poop, I am ſure his time had been better employed if he had ordered the Gunner to have turned the muzzles of two or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:135601:19"/>three Guns downe into the Hatchway, and have ſunk the Ship, which he omitting to doe in time, did very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſpirit, and I think may be rank'd among the higheſt of his failings: But I think there is too much of that before.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place he tels a long ſtory of what the Great Duke ſaid, among others I think it will little advantage him; for is that Expreſſion becauſe Authority ſhould be incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me: Then thus, The Great Duke ſaid Capt. <hi>Appletons</hi> Crime was unpardonable in that he came not out to my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in nor after my firſt Engagement; would he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have Authority incens'd againſt me meerly upon ſuch a ſcore?</p>
            <p>But then, ſome of Mr. <hi>Longlands</hi> houſe, ſome about the Duke, <hi>Italians, French, &amp;c.</hi> are brought in to ſpeak he knows not what, nor it may be they themſelves; but two witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are brought in at laſt, that were then ſo ſober as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſome <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> had ſaid they would teare me in pieces for a Coward if ever I came thither. I ſuppoſe if this ſtuffe be weighed (in the Ballance of underſtanding mens Judgements) it will be found very ridiculous.</p>
            <p>Becauſe ſome Engliſh Merchant hath ſaid ſundry times upon the place of <hi>Legorn, What Newes from our Rogues at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter?</hi> meaning the Parliament (although it's a ſhame Engliſh men ſhould ſo ſpeak (was the Parliament ever the worſe for that? And although <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> have been heard many a time ſay, They could teare ſome worthy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our State to pieces upon the account of being enemies to the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> would it not be a ridiculous thing for him that heard ſuch expreſſions, to acquaint the Higher Powers of it, in hopes to bring them into diſ-reputation upon ſuch a ſcore?</p>
            <p>What though the Spectators at <hi>Legorn,</hi> were a thouſand <hi>Legorn</hi> Ladies, and as many Fooles and Knaves among them, is that any thing to me? Were they not like a Company that being in a Ladies Chamber near the Sea-coaſt, ſeeing a Ship with ſome little wind and ſea, to their underſtanding, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving into a Bay, and not being able to get off the ſhore, by weathering one point or other, cut the maſt by the bord, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:135601:20"/>all that time they cryed out, <hi>Oh Fooles, oh Knaves,</hi> what, cut your Maſts by the bord this weather? looſe ſo much of your friends intereſt that might be ſav'd? not conſidering the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that are ſubject to happen on bord Ship, when thoſe that were there ſaw they could not get off with a ſaile; and peradventure he that had Command perceived there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his Ship but an old Junck, unto which there is no truſt at all to be given, without his Maſts be parted withall.</p>
            <p>Indeed if the Spectators had fleſh'd ſome of the Great Dukes old Gallies, and had with them ſuch inſtruments, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-uſers, as walk to and againe among the Banks in theſe Veſſels, and would have come to tow our Ship too and again, when ſhe would not ſteere, and if then we would have done no more then we did, indeed they might juſtly have ſaid ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our diſparagement.</p>
            <p>But what need I ſpeak ſo much of them, I wiſh there may be none in the world who pretend to better principles, that would not (at leaſt in word and thought) condemne and execute before they heare, contrary to the manner of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Heathens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now finiſht my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Remonſtrancers,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have not onely opened the dreſſe it was made up in, but ſhewed the filthy malice from whence ſuch productions as are there held out, did iſſue forth; and I doe believe moſt noble and ingenuous ſpirits will confeſſe, I am no more worthy to be blamed in what paſt neer <hi>Legorn</hi> the 4 of <hi>March</hi> laſt, then I was to be blam'd for what paſt among as the 28 and 29 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> before, wherein God made me inſtrumentall to ſave a better Ship then the <hi>Leopard,</hi> and a vaſt Eſtate of the Nations, for then I did but my endeavour, and both that, with my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution will be prov'd to be every whit as much in the laſt, as in the former Diſpute, ſo long as in reaſon there was any hope; although I confeſſe it was not anſwer'd from Heaven with ſuch ſucceſſe: And if any man will yet ſay, <hi>I would have done more had I been in your place,</hi> I hope he will give me leave to think, that more knowing men would have blamed his prudence, then there is, that would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his valour.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:135601:20"/>
            <p>In fine, I ſuppoſe if all the paines and care I was at, were well weighed, to keep our Ships from ruine in <hi>Porto Longone,</hi> and what was done to get Victuall and other neceſſaries for the people ten Moneths together, with the correſpondence I held with moſt adjacent places.</p>
            <p>As alſo, what hardſhip I under-went in ſundry Journeyes by Sea and Land, to effect the conjunction of both Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, having been way-laid as I was inform'd ſundry times. And if it be alſo conſidered what averſneſſe and contrarineſſe was in moſt peoples ſpirits (unto this Common-wealths ſervice) with whom I had to doe, which men we were yet forc't to make uſe of, it muſt needs be concluded, Never any ſubject of State or Prince, could poſſibly undergo more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the time, then I have gone through.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, what I crave is onely good acceptance, and that which of right belongs unto me; and the like I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in the behalfe of the States faithfull Servant, Mr. <hi>Charles Longland,</hi> whom the Remonſtrancer hath greatly abus'd. My practice ſhall not be after the manner of thoſe in <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> who going up to that Pallace, take fire on their head, and cry, <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice;</hi> but I hope I ſhall have that when I go elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, which will be like fire in my heart, to kindle deſires, that <hi>Davids</hi> laſt words may be remembred:</p>

And I hope what I have to ſay, will not be accounted impertinent to the purpoſe of clearing up the Truth.</head>
            <p>NOt to mention any thing of thoſe crying ſins w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> did not onely make a <hi>Turke,</hi> that being taken with the Excellency of the way of Chriſt, and had made ſome profeſſion of our Religion, for ſome Months together abord the <hi>Leopard,</hi> to naucite it, and turne from it (conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if God were a Holy God, thoſe that run into ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities muſt not be his people) which yet doubtleſſe did provoked God to ſtretch out his hand againſt us.</p>
            <p>Nor yet to mention any failing of thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſhould have done well to have ſent us ſome kind of reliefe.</p>
            <p>But abroad, by what hath been ſaid, and is hinted in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Letters I now preſent, there may be clearly diſcerned a perfect number of particulars, ſhewing what were the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments to our Conjunction, and conſequently where the blame ought to be laid; and if the Conſcience of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancer, and his Aſſociates will but ſpeak out, I am aſſured they muſt ſixe and and annex their Acknowledgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as unto a moſt real truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſtubborneſſe of the Commanders of the <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and the dulneſſe and backwardneſſe of the Commander of the Navy Ships to come out to our Aſſiſtance, upon and after our firſt Engagement, although greatly inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto by other Commanders, that in every reſpect were under the ſame capacity and obligation with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and it appeareth by ſundry Letters from Mr. <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Conſul <hi>Read,</hi> Capt. <hi>Wood,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That imprudent act of the Remonſtrancer, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135601:21"/>in his owne perſon, forcing back a Dutch-man his priſoner from the Great Dukes Centinels houſe, whereunto he had made his eſcape, caus'd the Duke to ſend a Meſſenger into <hi>England,</hi> which otherwiſe had not been ſent, as (upon good grounds) Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> advis'd me from time to time, and as was the opinion of the Conſul, and other knowing Merchants, and conſequently the diſſatisfactory Anſwer he had returned by that Meſſenger, had not more incens'd him againſt us then the naturall genius of Princes towards young Common-wealths would have prompt him unto; ſo that peradventure, although he lov'd not the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet he would not have thruſt their Ships into the mouths of their Enemies (upon the matter) as he did afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The not coming of our three Friggots &amp; the <hi>Harry Bonaventure</hi> from <hi>Naples</hi> unto <hi>Porto Longone,</hi> whil'ſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had no conſiderable ſtrength to reſiſt us, but contrary to Order going back to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and I know not where, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a great deale of time, while we might have done our buſineſs with as much ſeaſonableneſſe as our heart could deſire; and this appeareth by ſundry Letters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The exceeding backwardneſſe and unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſome of thoſe Commanders of Engliſh Ships at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> to embrace the States ſervice without ſuch tearmes as could not be well agreed unto by the States ſervants; for thereby ſuch a needleſſe diſpute aroſe, that caus'd ſo much time to be ſpent to no purpoſe, which (in all probability) had been ſufficient to have effected our Conjunction, before the 4 of <hi>March</hi> laſt; and this will appear by ſundry Letters from indifferent perſons that were lookers on, as well as from the States Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Great Dukes partiality, whether becauſe the Dutch were then like to be the ſtrongeſt ſide, or for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I know not; but I am ſure he dealt very unworthily with the States Servants, in commanding us out the Port, when as the Enemy was near three to one; and after he had made many complaints of the above-mentioned, for viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Ports, to give the Dutch liberty to aſſault our Ships when their ſternes were in the <hi>Mould</hi>-head, and although we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:135601:22"/>were promis'd from time to time, great aſſiſtance from his Cannons, in caſe the Enemy ſhould meddle with us within their reach, not to ſhoot a ſhot in our defence, when as ſome of our Ships were ſurpriſed within little more then musket ſhot of his works, was worſe then all the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Remonſtrancers omitting to come out in the night, when as I ſent for them in ſuch a ſeaſon, wherein ſome of thoſe that were Pylots, in effect, ſaid of their Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, They were curſed becauſe they took not hold of that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; and the omiſſion was quite contrary to Capt. <hi>Appletons</hi> promiſe, by his Letter to me of the 3, 13 of <hi>March,</hi> for therein in Anſwer to my former Letter, he would come out in the night, if he had my approbation, and he wanted not that, with expreſſions from my Lievtenant, how earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous I was to have had them come away with all ſpeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> and laſtly, Coming out (contrary to their owne deliberate reſult at a Conſultation) before that I was engag'd with the Enemy; whereas notwithſtanding, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſimply inſerts concerning my requiring him to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten out to me as for life, three or four dayes before the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, his Letter of the 3, 13 of <hi>March</hi> tels me he had receiv'd my Letters and Orders dated that morning at four a Clock, if that were produc'd (of which I had no time to take a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or have loſt it) I am confident therein it will be found expreſt, I was ſo far from bidding them haſten to me as for life, that <hi>per contra,</hi> I deſired he would not ſtir (meaning in the day time) until he ſaw me engag'd, and in effect he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth as much, by ſaying in the afore-mention'd Letter, that <hi>He thank'd me for my care in not hazzarding that Squadron:</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which I ſhall adde no more, but that I am,</p>

            <head>AS I was upon returning in with the foregoing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I have met with a printed paper intituled, <hi>A Relation of the Fight neare</hi> Legorn-<hi>Road, the</hi> 4 <hi>of</hi> March <hi>laſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>And caſting my eye upon it, I find a Declaration from C. <hi>Seaman,</hi> from C. <hi>Ell,</hi> and from Cap. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> which I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver liberty to ſee before, and ſo it's not poſſible for me to give an Anſwer thereunto at preſent.</p>
            <p>And although therein I find ſuch horrid falſities, as fils me with admiration, in regard ſuch is their boldneſſe to doe it, even as we uſe to ſay, in the very face of Authority, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing, it's <hi>Printed by the Printer to the Parliament of</hi> ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you give me leave to declare what is on my heart, like as in a veſſel that wants vent, and I hope no levity will be found therein.</p>
            <p>As the Lord is ſometimes pleaſed to prevent his by the bleſſings of goodneſſe, ſo the Remonſtrancer, and thoſe that ſeem to imbark in the ſame cauſe with him, ſuch I heare, as would have been well pleaſed with a ſecond Revolt, I ſay they have prevented me, or quite out-ſtript what I could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine (in point of broaching about their miſchievous ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) ſo far as the condition of <hi>London</hi> (in the caſe it now ſtands) is different from the condition of <hi>Oxford,</hi> eight or nine yeares ſince.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not yet ſay all men are Lyars, or that many have been ſo, neither ſhall I yet Query (as one did with his ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:135601:23"/>eſcaping many a knock that others have met with, among malicious Anvils.</p>
            <p>But this I ſhall conclude, that as the <hi>people is happy whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> ſo that particular perſon is happy whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt lies there: And give me leave to adde, of him that hath truth on his ſide, like <hi>Oyle,</hi> it will be uppermoſt when all is done, and let men doe what they can.</p>

            <p>In the next place, although I would not exaſperate a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or hunt after the utmoſt ſeverity of Juſtice, but rather ſeek after lenity and mercy in caſe of acknowledgment: yet in the cloſe I ſhall commend unto your Grave Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what I heard was concluded among ſome ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, many years ſince: <hi>To ſuffer an inferiour Officer to be abus'd, is juſt as if a man ſhould ſuffer his ſervant to take hold of any part of his arme, and that commonly opens a gappe, or proclaimes ſome kind of liberty to take hold of his Collar;</hi> or thoſe Officers (that although ſubordinate) are very neer to him: And further, for that to be ſuffered, it opens a paſſage to the Maſters throat, which every man knowes is very dangerous.</p>

               <p>ALthough I have domeſtick ſorrow in the loſſe of my ſervant this morning, yet my mind runs on the great danger I apprehend may befall you there, if others beſide your ſelfe doe not ſtir, and take it into conſideration. I was once in hope of the going out of Capt. <hi>Appleton,</hi> and ſome others with him, that I aſſured unto my ſelfe a defeat of theſe ſhips that lay in this Port, as well as a reliefe, and beating the Enemy thence, which doubtleſſe upon the ſight of theſe would gladly have eſcaped hence; but however it hath been delayed, and let ſlip ſo probable an opportunity, Heave to them it concerns to anſwer, I wiſh they themſelves
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:135601:26"/>with your Squadron, do not come endangered thereby, the unhappy loſs of the <hi>Phoenix</hi> Frigot hath daunted ſom, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd the enemy, who as I wrot was diligent &amp; vigilant both in gathering Merchants ſhips into their ſervice, as in ſhipping any ſort or Nation to man them, and therein they ſtir; we have now 8 ſhips of them lying in the road, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending our intended Fire-ſhip, and that unhappy <hi>quandum Phaenix</hi> Frigot in the Mould. God ſtrengthen you all, and thoſe here, with ſpirits to provide for your ſelves. I have noted to you all the ſhips here, and the <hi>Harry Bonyventure</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> as the <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Civita Vechia.</hi> An aſſurance of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and a loving Letter from you, as Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, if they, or theſe ſhould refuſe aſſiſtance in ſo emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent an occaſion; when you by a Councel of War ſhall think convenient for the preſervation of that Squadron, and wherein lyeth involv'd, as I apprehend, in part, the Honour of our Nation, together with the great Eſtates of many Merchants (I ſay under correction) I apprehend all ought to give their aſſiſtance; but in this, and matters of ſuch concernments, I ſhall leave unto your Reſults, in caſe you pleaſe to debate theron. And I will pray God to direct you for the beſt, and in the interim, neither will I be idle; I have wrote unto a friend at <hi>Rome,</hi> to procure the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors Letters as unto <hi>Genoa,</hi> for others thence, all in your favour to that Governour. This is what I thought upon, when I ſee my endeavours could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure theſe ſhips going forth. If I can think of ought elſe may be ſerviceable unto you, or that you may apprehend I may ſerve you in, pleaſe to command, you ſhall alwayes find me (no leſſe then ever you knew me) ready to ſerve and promote the welfare of our Nation, as if I may in your perticular ſerve you, ſo it be without jealouſie to encroach; you ſhall finde me alwayes</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:135601:27"/>not putting the ſame in execution in ſuch eminent and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent occaſions, I apprehend Authority with compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould have been uſed, with promiſe of pay from the State for the ſervice, and indempnity unto the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for their Ownets and Merchants, this would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them unexcuſable, and without queſtion the State would have gratefully ratified ſuch a reſolution in their Miniſters and Commanders, which I not onely preſſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unto Capt. <hi>Appleton,</hi> but unto M. <hi>Longland,</hi> out of zeale to the preſervation and reputation of the Nation.

               <p>I Am now come to Anſwer yours of the 17 and 19 cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: The Great Duke hath writ downe Newes hither to the Colonel, that 22 Engliſh or Dutch ſhips have been ſeen on the Coaſt of <hi>Spaine,</hi> I believe about the end of the next Month we may expect our ſhips if their reſolutions hold. The Letter you ſent for the Great Duke I ſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and herewith return you his Anſwer: About the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you make of the Great Duke for your free Egreſſe and Regreſſe, I thought it more ſecure to write for it, that I might have it under his hand, then to take an Anſwer by word of mouth, ſo I herewith ſend you Signior <hi>Pandolfini</hi> his Secretary of State's Letter to me in Anſwer. For what you ſay about the Dukes impriſonment of Capt. <hi>Appleton,</hi> unheard, all the Princes in the world are on the ſame trade, and ſteere their courſe after one manner. What doe you think had become of the five Members of Parliament, if the late King had found them; beſides his impriſonment, not a man could be ſuffer'd to ſpeak with him, thoſe few lines he wrote were all tranſlated at Court, before they came to our hands. You know very well how unlimited a thing an abſolute Prince is, wherefore in this Countrey we muſt have patience. I told the Great Duke the Common-wealth ſuffer'd in their reputation by Capt. <hi>Appleton's</hi> impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but he anſwer'd he would give them good ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein. I perceive Capt. <hi>Roope</hi> will know nothing of Capt. <hi>Bowman</hi> to Command the <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135601:33"/>wants a good Commander, for the Maſter is not right, never from the ſhore. I herewith ſend you Capt. <hi>Cox</hi> Letter, wherein you may ſee what there paſſes, I have given him credit on M. <hi>Baker</hi> for what his occaſions require to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his Ship. C. <hi>Peacocke</hi> is to bring you out twenty ſail of Ships to be under your Command: The incloſed from <hi>Eng:</hi> will acquaint you with what paſſes there; you need not doubt in the leaſt of your free coming hither, this is my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and you will ſee as much by the Secretaries Letter.

The Dutch have now ſhewed us the way, that 'tis lawful to doe any thing in Road or Mould, when we have a power and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to doe it; for two dayes paſt I laded 50 Cheſts of Tinn upon a French ſhip, for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> upon which I took 2400 <hi>d.</hi> of the Captain at <hi>Cambio,</hi> but the Tinn was worth 1600 <hi>d.</hi> more, the Dutch having intelligence of it, the French man riding to the north of the Road, two ſhips made ſaile towards her, and ſent 4 arm'd Boats abord her, and took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Tinn: I have ſent away a Carrier to the Great Duke, to acquaint him with it, but I fear his Anſwer wilbe the ſame as the Governour gives me, that it muſt goe upon account of the Frigot: At leaſt we now clearly ſee by this action, that when we have a power we need not be ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in what place we fall upon the Enemy; and although an unhappy loſſe be fallen upon me, yet it may prove ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the generall buſineſſe: I ſhall to morow have anſwer from <hi>Florence,</hi> what the Great Duke ſayes to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineſſe, whereof my next ſhall adviſe you.

Laſt night the Secretary ſhewed us the Great Dukes Letter to you, in anſwer to yours from <hi>Porto Ferraro,</hi> that he gave us liberty to the 18 of this month to get out, and longer then, if wind and weather hindred: He takes very well what you propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning the freedome of his Port, and ha's been all this day (as he ſaith) endeavouring to get <hi>Van Gallen</hi> to under-write the ſame likewiſe; but whil'ſt they were in Treaty, Newes came to <hi>Van Gallen</hi> that you were on the way from <hi>Porto Ferraro,</hi> ſo nothing was effected; the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary tels me within this hour he will ſend again to him, and I hold it not convenient that the ſhips ſtir out of the Mould, til an anſwer come, except the Dutch weigh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and goe out to you, in ſuch caſe they muſt all out of the Mould, come what will.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135601:37"/>to aſſault them in the Road; theſe are ſymtomes that the Road is theirs that win it, as I cannot get ſo much from them in plaine tearms, neither will I perſwade you to begin any hoſtility in the Road, for I believe you will not want provocation, or at leaſt the ſhips now here before you come in, yet I would not wiſh you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from any notable advantage, upon nicities, when no aſſurance or certainty can be got from any of theſe great Officers. The ſhips are all ready to undertake any thing that is within the compaſſe of poſſibility, but except part of the Dutch goe out to you, or at leaſt your Fleet come in to our ſuccour, it is impoſſible for theſe ſhips to get away without great loſſe and hazard. The Great Dukes Letter unto you was ſent to</hi> Porto Ferraro, <hi>and is thence come back to my hands, which I would have ſent you tranſlated, if time would permit, but I doubt not but it will be well done, by ſome with you. I muſt not omit to tell you, that the Collonel this day told me, if our ſhips were worſted in this incounter, and came back thither for a Port, the Frigot muſt then be reſtored. The great deſigne of the Flemmings is to ſpoyle them ſhips in the Mould, which I believe is the cauſe they will not ſtir to come out to you.</hi>

I need not write you the various cenſures here upon your going away. All the</hi> 4 <hi>ſhips were loſt before you came up; of this you will heare at home, as alſo the full relation of the unhappy loſſe of our ſhips. For my part I was no Spectator, for when I ſaw them ſo ſuddenly goe out of the Mould, upon the back of the Enemy (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own deliberate reſult in a Councell of War that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to ſtir thence till the Enemy had engaged you) I went into my Chamber, where I kept my ſelfe, fearing that ſucceſſe which befell them: By noon the Tragedy was ended, the</hi> Leopard <hi>being the laſt ſhip, who had ſtrength enough to clear her ſelfe, if ſhe had either the courage or diſcretion to make uſe of it: The Dutch themſelves report, if ſhe had but ask'd for thoſe ſhips that lay abord her, ſhe might have had them.

If the State take not ſome order to tame ſuch men, it will not be in my power to doe them any ſervice, nor fit to be a Commiſſioned ſervant of theirs, when I ſhall be ſubject to the abuſe of ſuch a ſcandalous fellow, whoſe extream Malignancy and backwardneſſe, ha's been the ruine of all our ſhips here; and now he ha's baſely loſt his ſhip, he vents his venome to the full; there were above forty Witneſſes of this abuſe.

               <p>THeſe are to certifie whomſoever it doth concerne, That being Lievtenant in the States ſhip <hi>Parragon,</hi> about midnight, before the 4 of <hi>March</hi> laſt, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral ſeeing a freſh gale of wind off the ſhore, cals me to him, when as we ſeem'd to be neer the Lanthorne, and with great earneſtneſſe bids me haſten into <hi>Legorn</hi>-Mould with the Feluca, and tel Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> that he ſhould cal the reſt of the Captaines immediately, and there acquaint them, that he did effectually recommend it to their conſideration, to come away to him: I went accordingly, and told him my meſſage, but notwithſtanding ſome of the Captaines came together, Capt. <hi>Fiſher</hi> could not be made riſe to come thither in an houre after, and when they did come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they were ſo long in concluding what to doe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they would, and ſometimes they would not, Capt. <hi>Seaman</hi> lying on Capt. <hi>Appletons</hi> Couch like a Lordaine moſt part of the time. In concluſion, when it was nois'd on the <hi>Leopards</hi> upper deck that they would not goe out til morning, I heard one <hi>Wrightington</hi> a Maſters Mate, or Pylot of the ſhip, ſay theſe words in a paſſion, as if he would tear his haire, <hi>Theſe curſed men</hi> (meaning the Commanders) <hi>are ſo bewitched or beſotted to this Mould, that they care not for going hence, why cannot we goe having ſuch a gallant gale of wind, now that the Admirall hath ſent for us.</hi>

               <p>Returning to our ſhip the <hi>Parragon,</hi> at break of day, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135601:40"/>our ſelves to be ſomewhat further off then we made account, I am able to teſtifie, all ſaile was made to ply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Legorn</hi>-Road, as poſſible could be, until about an houre after, that the Dutch Fleet was come out neer <hi>Mount Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro,</hi> and then their head-moſt ſhips bearing off directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, our Main-ſaile was hail'd up for halfe an houre, as was all the reaſon in the world, that we might have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder us from plying all our Guns between Decks, that our men might be ready to ſtand by our great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but as ſoone as ever our Ships came out of the Mould, all the ſaile the wind would give leave, was kept abroad, and the Admiral plyed in with all diligence, and to my knowledge it was firſt declared by him, his reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to bord the Dutch Admiral, but coming ſo neer her as that we could diſcharge a Volley of ſmal ſhot to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purpoſe, we did it, together with a broad ſide of great Ordnance; and ſeeing none of our Frigots going on bord to the relief of the <hi>Leopard,</hi> our Captaine ſeeing ſo many of the Fleet loſt, judging it the moſt neceſſarieſt ſervice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe her, we ſtood towards that ſhip, but being the wind was very freſh, it was not held fit we ſhould run ſtemlings with all our ſailes (except the Main-ſaile, and top-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ſailes, for ends before denoted) however after we had powred a broad ſide into the <hi>Julius Coeſar,</hi> and paſt within two or three ſhips lengths of her ſterne, great indeavours were uſed to make our ſhip <hi>Parragon</hi> bear up, that we might come to the other tack, that ſo we might goe on bord with the more eaſe; but it pleaſed God the wind dullard all on the ſudden, ſo that we could not make our ſhip work, nor bear up in any time, if all our lives had laine on't, and then bringing our ſhip to againe, before we could make her ſtay, we were ſhot ſo far, that before poſſible we could get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord the <hi>Leopard,</hi> ſhe was driven ſo neer the ſand of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lora,</hi> that it was my opinion humbly given in to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral among other Officers, in caſe we ſhould have further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to have gone on bord, it would be almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ever to diſintangle our ſelves from them againe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we had been upon the afore-mentioned ſand, the wind
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:135601:40"/>being at E. S. E. moſt commonly: And to my knowledge, when the Captaine ſaw that the ſhip would not work, he order'd ſome of the nimble ſhips to be cal'd unto to doe that ſervice, and if the <hi>Mary</hi> or the <hi>Lewis</hi> had beene neer us, they had been cal'd to as wel as the <hi>Mary Roſe.</hi> And I am confidently aſſured, that ſuch as did leaſt in our Fleet, did as much ſervice againſt the Enemy, to deſtroy ſuch as borded the <hi>Leopard,</hi> as did either Capt. <hi>Ell,</hi> or Capt. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher;</hi> and whatever the Captaines of theſe ſhips ſay now we are come home, I am ſure in our homeward bound way it was the vote and expreſſion of them, and all other Captaines in the Fleet, that if we had engag'd any further in the buſineſſe of <hi>Legorn,</hi> all had been loſt. </p>

               <head>The eleventh Affidavit.</head>
               <p>I <hi>David Booth,</hi> being a Mate on the <hi>Parragon,</hi> do teſtifie, That the 4 of <hi>March</hi> laſt, from one a clock i'the morn: until it was day (when we ſeem'd to be neer the Lantern of <hi>Legorn</hi>) God was pleaſed to give our ſhips in the Mould as faire an opportunity for coming out to us, as men could deſire, by a freſh gale of wind at E. N. E. ſo that in all likelihood they might have weather'd the Enemy above a mile, they riding all faſt at an Anchor in the Road, but neglecting to put Capt. <hi>Badiley's</hi> Order in execution, proved their ruine, as alſo their not working, as men ought to have done, next morning, for had they ſtayed while the Dutch had com to Lee-ward upon us, and engaged us, they might have done good ſervice, by following on the back of the Enemy, for all men ſaw, coming out as they did, they thruſt themſelves into danger, and all reaſonable men might well have thought, the Enemy would have tack't back on them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us ſo far to Lee-ward, that we could not come in to their ſuccour, in two or three houres time.</p>
               <p>And moreover I can teſtifie, That as ſoon as ever the word was given, the ſhips were coming out of the Mould, we did as much as was poſſible for men to do, haſtening in with all the ſail we could make, to the hazard of our Maſts.</p>
               <p>And being come neer, I am ſure no man could ſhew more reſolution to carry on the work of the day, then our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ſhewed, and required all men to fit, for that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bord the Dutch Admiral, and when we gave her a broad ſide, that had been done, but that we ſaw the <hi>Leopard</hi> wanted relief, ſo we went to diſentangle the <hi>Leopard,</hi> from thoſe Enemies on bord her in the firſt place, and going by thoſe ſhips within Piſtol ſhot, our ſhip would not bear up, that the Capt. deſire in going on bord that cluſter of ſhips, might be effected, if al our lives had lain on't; but if the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard</hi> had let goe an Anchor, they might have clear'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with eaſe, yet they did it not, all men were hous'd, not a man to be ſeen on her upper Deck.</p>
               <p>And whereas I have heard, that Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> ſhould ſay
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:135601:46"/>Capt. <hi>Badiley</hi> would not ſuccour him, nor ſuffer any others to doe it, it is a moſt falſe thing; for I am confident our Captain was in ſuch a paſſion when he ſaw our ſhip would not work, that he ſeem'd to tear his haire, in regard none of our nimble ſhips would doe what he was not able to doe; and afterwards, when the <hi>Parragon</hi> was got about by making a ſhort trip, and ſtaying, there was then no reaſon to have gone abord the <hi>Leopard,</hi> ſhe being laid ſo far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſand, the wind being at E.

               <p>And in 1640. I was a Maſters-Mate on the ſaid ſhip with Capt. <hi>Ri: Badiley,</hi> about <hi>Cape Paul,</hi> we were laid abord by 2 <hi>Turks,</hi> men of War, that were Caſtles in compariſon to us, and by report had at leaſt 500 men to our 44, who entring us, were beat back, where many were forc't to leap over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord; and although many times we were fired and burnt very much, in ſeveral places, yet God keeping up the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of both our Commander, and Company, ſo it was (through Gods aſſiſtance) that I believe never any could doe more in a diſpute of that nature; the Commander coming to encourage the men, would ſay, <hi>Come gallants, let me know how it is with you now, they would cry fore and aft, we want nothing, but a new place in the Enemies ſide, to make a new hole in.</hi> In fine, how they were baffled, that ones Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt and Bowſprit was ſhot by the bord, and the other torne ſo lamentably, as I believe ever ſhip was, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to budge or ſtir. Several men yet living, well
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135601:48"/>know, who ſaw many of their great platformes of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance diſ-mounted, and not above one man on all their middle Deck, with their Guns, but the greateſt part of their men run into the Hold, and the <hi>Turks</hi> can beſt of all tell how they felt it.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Anno</hi> 1644, of <hi>Matril</hi> with Capt. <hi>Badiley,</hi> in the ſaid ſhip all alone, three <hi>Turkes</hi> men of War came fiercely up with us, as if they would deſtroy us at once, who could not have leſſe then 4 or 500 men, to our 44, yet by Gods aſſiſtance, although our Commander cal'd them abord, they were ſo diſheartened at our firſt broad ſide, that like Doggs with their tailes between their leggs, they run away from us, with all the ſaile they could make, and never ſhot at us more, for hindring their way.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Parragon</hi> being a Mate and Pylot there, in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> neer <hi>Corſigo</hi> the 27 and 28 of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> ſuch was our Commanders reſolution in the face of the Enemy, that I am perſwaded it's impoſſible for any man to be more; and after that we had about fourſcore men kil'd and wounded in our ſhip, and my ſelfe wounded in three places, ſo that I was not able to help my ſelfe, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, yet I know whereas he plac't every man anew at his Quarters, and each man over night gave his hand to live and dye with him next day, if occaſion were; howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the 29 day in the morning, about the coming downe of our Main-yard, moſt of the men were ſo rallyed into a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous diſtemper, that they ſaid, <hi>If the Enemy comes up we ſhall have no Quarter, let's be gone with the Frigots, another ſhot ſhall not be made;</hi> but I ſuppoſe it was occaſioned withall from a report there was of 45 foot water in the ſhip.</p>
               <p>At that time ſeeing one <hi>Hide</hi> with two or three others ſtanding in a knot, I ſaid, <hi>Good Sirs, we that did ſuch good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice yeſterday, let's not leave the Commander to day; if this ſhip, and ſo great a ſtrength of the Nations be loſt, it would be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſgrace that ever befell our Nation;</hi> he replyed, <hi>Wee'l fight no more, the State hath better ſhips, but we have no more lives.</hi> Nay to ſuch a height the mutiny was growne, that I have
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:135601:49"/>heard ſome ſay, <hi>If the Captaine would not ſuffer them to call for Quarter, they would ſtowe him well enough,</hi> or words to that purpoſe.</p>

            <p>IN <hi>February,</hi> 1649 or 50, hearing how well he had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelfe under Col. <hi>Lidcott,</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and withal conſidering how earneſtly he had deſired to be employed under me in Merchant Affaires, having then the moſt conſiderableſt intereſt in the ſhip <hi>Perrigrine,</hi> that was impreſt into the States ſervice, I did in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner recommend him to the General, for the Command of that ſhip.</p>
            <p>And fithence he was employed in the States ſervice under me, in our late troubleſome Voyage, in the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he very well knoweth I endeavoured to engage him by ſeveral acts of civility, yet notwithſtanding all perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I could uſe, he preſumed to make the firſt breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the three ſhips of War of us, which were ſent out: whereupon, as I told him, it was very ill done, ſo I wiſht it might be the laſt breach he might make, although I fear'd the contrary.</p>
            <p>But now to come to the Engagement before ſignified.</p>
            <p>Whereas he was order'd to lye in one of the Quarters of the ſhip I was upon, and yet goeth a head (contrary to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) appeareth by a Letter to Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> under his own hand as followeth.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:135601:51"/>Merchant Ships having but fourty and odde men, by being careful to make all doores and hatches ſurely faſt, have maintain'd their Ships againſt ſuch of the enemies as have come on board them, and have had above four hundred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p>However in my firſt Letter to Authority in <hi>England,</hi> I wrote onely thus; <hi>In our diſpute the</hi> Phenix <hi>Friggot was loſt very ſtrangely, I wiſh (to ſpeak the leaſt) there had not beene careleſneſſe in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I appeal to all rational men, looking back to what is before related, whether I could have wrote more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately if Captain <hi>Wadſworth</hi> had been my brother; for by that expreſſion, I did not ſo tax him, but he might have cleared himſelf by imputing it on his men, if by their careleſneſſe the doores had not been made faſt, or by their cowardlines they had left their quarters in the ſteerage and Cabbin, and run elſewhere.</p>
            <p>But before I ſent away my next Letters, I heard the mans ſpirit was very high-flown, that now we were all taxt, as thoſe that dealt baſely, cowardly, and unworthily with him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the contents of the Letter he wrote Mr. <hi>Boneale,</hi> as follows.</p>

When I ſaw you laid on board of both ſides, and others ready to clap you thwart the hawſe, and one coming on your Bough, I thought the reſt would be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as my ſelf, being in a better capacity; but finding it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my expectation, and their unworthy promiſes, I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but the Fleet is preſerved by it, when I tack'd, I intended
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135601:52"/>not the laying of him aboard, but the keeping him off your ſelf; but our ſails and rigging being torne, we could not work our Ship, and had either of our two Friggots ſeconded me, however I had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him; but my men being many of them kill'd, and deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, and ſo many of the likelieſt of my men run away in my Boat, which I hope you will call to account: for had it not been that they ran away, I had got clear of them, for they had cut their Mainſtay to get clear of me.

            <p>That his Maſter, the great Duke had receiv'd a Letter from the Councel of State, appointed from authority of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England,</hi> wherein were courteous expreſſions; but there was nothing mentioned concerning the <hi>Phenix</hi> Friggot, which the Dutch pretended unto; and abſolutely his Maſter muſt, and would ſee them ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which I made this modeſt reply;</hi>
            </p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                  </opener>
                  <p>AS you have well denoted, I believe the Letter ſent his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by order from the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> is not only
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:135601:54"/>full of courteous, but reall acknowledgements of the great eſteem they have of his Highneſs favour, in vouchſafing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection for their Ships in this place; and I believe at all times his Highneſſe may be confident that (in a reciprocal manner) the Engliſh Nation will acknowledge the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The Councel of State alſo hath been pleas'd to ſignifie unto me that their pleaſure is, Cap. <hi>Appleton</hi> ſhall returne over land into <hi>England</hi> with all ſpeed, to give an account why he did aſſault the great Dukes Centinel, (for, as I alwayes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that uncivill act caus'd his Highneſſe to diſpatch away the Meſſenger into <hi>England</hi>) and in the next place, I ſuppoſe they will be inform'd from him, how the <hi>Phenix</hi> Friggot was regain'd; whereupon, if they finde it juſtice, or reaſon, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will give immediate order, that the great Duke ſhall make the Dutch ſatisfaction in the beſt manner he may, and what he doth therein, they will ſo ſtand to it, as that his Highneſſe ſhall be no ſufferer. But now leſt Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> ſhould not arrive in <hi>England</hi> ſo ſoon as the ordinary; if it pleaſe you, I will adde to what I have formerly wrote the Councel of State, ſuch a full relation about the manner of that Friggots ſurprizall, as that it muſt give a clear light to the underſtanding of that buſineſſe; and I will preſume once in 45. or 48. days the great Duke ſhall have a punctual anſwer, ſo that he will ſee what they will do in that matter, which referres to the <hi>Phenix</hi> Friggot, and ſo we parted at that time.</p>
                  <p>About two or three dayes after he ſends for me aſhor, and I could not deny but attend accordingly: for you muſt note, although this were a Treaty, it was a forc'c one; (on my part) I was conſtrain'd to attend what this Secretary of State would ſay to me, and could no more (as I conceive) avoid hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he ſhould ſay, then I could prevent the great Duke from putting one of our Mariners to the Torture (at our enemies inſtance.) I know not for what cauſe, next to the reverence we did him, and reſpective ſalutes we made him at paſſing by, except it was, becauſe he had heard two or three dayes before that the Dutch commanded in our Channel, and were like to be the ſtrongeſt ſide.</p>
                  <p>But when Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> and my ſelf came thither; he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:135601:54"/>asked us, whether we had thought on what he had before mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd concerning giving ſome ſatisfaction about the <hi>Phenix</hi> Friggot?</p>
                  <p>Anſwer was made in words, to this effect.</p>
                  <p>We have wrote by this ordinary expreſſely to know what the States pleaſure is in that buſineſſe, doubtleſſe they will give the great Duke ſatisfaction about it; He anſwered, oh the great Duke would have preſent ſatisfaction that he might ſtop the mouthes of the Dutch.</p>
                  <p>It was replied by us, the Dutch had taken a great parcell of Tinne which belonged to our Nation, out of French veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and others, even under the Cannons of his Highneſſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting upon the matter as much as the <hi>Phenix</hi> Friggot was valued at; and beſides, we told him the Dutch themſelves bragg'd every day upon the place, that they had taken an Engliſh Ship from under the Caſtle of <hi>Lant,</hi> and another from under the Caſtle of <hi>Allicant,</hi> and ſo were made good foure times the value of the <hi>Phenix</hi> Friggot already; and in our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion it could not but render his Highneſſe among all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be very partial, if he looked for further ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>In fine, he told us plainly, the great Dukes pleaſure was, that one of the States Ships ſhould be diſarmed, and have her Rudder and Sailes taken aſhore; To that his concluſion, we made anſwer thus: The great Duke is Patron, and he may do what ſeemes him good; but one day an account muſt be given of the damage that the State of <hi>England</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thereby, or words to that purpoſe, and ſo we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd.</p>
                  <p>About this time one of the great Dukes Subjects Veſſels going out of the <hi>Mould</hi> with ſome proviſions for our Ships at Port <hi>Ferraro,</hi> as ſoon as ever ſhe was about the <hi>Mould</hi> head, was chas'd by the Dutch <hi>Tartan,</hi> and without the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had cut away his Boat, and bore his quick-ſide in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe had been ſnapt; and yet (upon the matter) no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was taken of it.</p>
                  <p>This piece of inſolency added to all the reſt, cauſed me, with the advice of friends to write to the great Duke theſe nſuing lines.</p>

                  <p>WHereas it hath been your pleaſure to honour me with a credential Letter, bearing date the eighth inſtant; foure dayes ſince I receiv'd it by the hands of that Right Worthy and Honourable perſon, your Secretary of State, from whom I was inform'd of what was his meſſage from your Highneſſe, and unto whom I returned ſuch a modeſt, and humble anſwer, as I hope hath been ſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>Among other commands, the Councel of State (ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by authority from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi>) hath required me (as well out of reſpect of what I oblig'd my ſelf unto your Highneſſe for in my former Letters, or humble addreſſes, as for other ends) in no caſe, nor upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to aſſault the Dutch in the Ports, and Chambers of your Highneſſe, except they firſt began with us the Engliſh, which commands, or orders of theirs, according to my duty, I ſhall readily render obedience unto.</p>
                  <p>But, may it pleaſe your Highneſſe, ſithence our enemies the Dutch do continually perſiſt and go on, without rendering that reſpect which is due unto your Highneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Ports and Chambers, and lording it over all men of ſundry Nations, do undertake to ſearch their veſſels, and being dexterous at the trade of plundring, in hopes of ſuch lucre, chaſe Barkes, and Veſſels paſſing about the <hi>Mould</hi> head, and that as well of the Subjects of your Highneſſe, as elſe how.</p>
                  <p>I do therefore humbly diſoblige my ſelf from what I have been formerly by Letter, or otherwiſe engaged unto; and being it's judg'd they have given the firſt aſſault, ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the commands before mentioned, I do hope it will not be taken amiſſe from your Highneſſe; although, (when ever power is in the hand of us the Engliſh,) we may take the

            <p>SO that in ditto Letter I gave his Highneſſe to underſtand, that although I would be very careful to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand I had receiv'd from the authorty of <hi>England</hi> not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe his Port, without the enemie began with us firſt; ſince it was very perſpicuous to every rational man, the Dutch had begun with us, I humbly withdrew my word, and crav'd leave to do what was reciprocall to the actions of the Dutch, whenever a power came into my hands.</p>
            <p>Now my reaſons for writing in that manner, were theſe briefly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, whereas (peradventure) the great Duke might think that <hi>England</hi> was loſt, becauſe the Dutch commanded in our Channel at the preſent; yet I judg'd not our Nation in ſo low a condition, but that I ſtill expected a Fleet of Ships to our aſſiſtance: And it was done that (at leaſt) he might be ſo much amus'd about it, as to believe I had private intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of ſome Friggots that were departed from the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> whom I might expect every moment, and thereby be enabled to deſtroy them in his Road, who had layen ſo long at the door, watching for our deſtruction. In fine hereby I thought the great Duke would be ſomewhat ſtartled, and begin to open his ear to what was propounded by me, ſo juſt and equal, and not appear ſo partial as he had done all along, ſince he heard of ſome defeat we had by the Dutch elſewhere.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:135601:56"/>
            <p>Secondly, I did it, that the Dutch (who were like to hear of it immediately) might be in ſome meaſure mortified; and for ought I knew inſtead of perſiſting, to have the Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Sailes, Rudder, and Ship <hi>Leopard,</hi> or <hi>Bonavanture</hi> to be conſign'd into the hands of the great Duke for their uſe, they might be put into ſome pannick fear, and have thoughts of removing either to meet their eight ſhips about the mouth of the Gulfe of <hi>Venice,</hi> and at <hi>Meſſina,</hi> or elſe to go Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward about <hi>Telloon</hi> to joyne with five good Ships of Warre they had that way, leſt when the ſtrength came out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that I expected thence, they might be ruin'd where they rode.</p>
            <p>The 19th. a returne of that Letter was preſented me by his Highneſſe Secretary, who having intimated he was at leiſure, and had ſomething to declare unto me from his Maſter, Mr. <hi>Longland,</hi> and my ſelf waited on him accordingly; but firſt the Letter followeth.</p>

            <p>And when I had read it, he ask'd me why I recall'd my word? It was anſwered, the Dutch violated the Port every day, and I hoped the Great Duke would not take it amiſſe if I could when I had power in my hands deſtroy them that were not onely originally the diſturbers thereof, but perſiſted therein from day to day; However, ſaid I, his Highneſſe may be confident I ſhall be at his command, ſo that I ſhall not proceed any further (in point of giving any diſturbance to his Port) then himſelf ſhall give liberty.</p>
            <p>But, ſaith Ditto Secretary, <hi>What will you do in order to what I spake to you the other day, about Conſigning one of the States Ships into the hands of the Great Duke, untill the Duke had ſatisfaction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwered, It is not in my power willingly to deliver up one of the States Ships to the Duke, or any other Prince or State, without ſpecial order from my Maſters in <hi>England; Well then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>His Highneſſe pleaſure is, you ſhall depart his Port, what ſay you to that?</hi> I replyed, that rather then I would willingly give conſent, that any of my Limbs ſhould be cut off, I would fight for the whole Body as long as I could.</p>
            <p>To which he made a further Reply, and ſaid; <hi>It was the Great Dukes order to tell me, that I muſt depart his Port, or</hi> Mould <hi>with the Engliſh Ships of warre, that were there once in ten dayes.</hi>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135601:57"/>him good, and although he knoweth beſt what he hath to do; yet in my opinion to require us to go out into the mouths of our enemies, when as they ſhall be three to one, would be an Eclipſe to his Honour among all the Princes in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and I inſtanced unto him the carriage of the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> towards Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> having once promiſed him protection in his Port; and proceeding in that diſcourſe, I told him, that as I was employed under the Generals in a ſervice near <hi>Lix.</hi> for the reduction of our revolted Ships, ſo I was a ſpectator of what paſt there, and although our General made it his requeſt to that King again and again, that a day might be appointed for the forementioned Ships to be commanded forth, that ſo we might keep the Honour of his Port unviolated, and yet diſpute for our own in the Sea; However he would not be prevailed withal about it: For, ſaid he, it would not ſtand with his Honour to command ſuch forth into the enemies hands, when there is oddes, who had craved his protection, and notwithſtanding all the time our Ships were under his command, we carried our ſelves civilly, not ſearching and plundering the veſſels of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and Lording it over all, as the Dutch did in <hi>Legorne</hi> Road; wherefore how can the Great Duke in point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour command us forth to gratifie ſuch inſolent enemies as ours were? yet, ſaid I, the above named practice cannot be commended in the aforementioned King, becauſe the Ships we then looked after, were the Common wealths of <hi>England,</hi> paid for with their own money, onely moſt of the perſons entruſted with them, revolted from their due obedience, which alters the caſe between their condition and ours, as much as may be; yet it holds out thus much, that Princes have had much reſpect to their Honour, in commanding thoſe with whom they are in amity to go from under their protection into the mouthes of their enemies, when they judge themſelves in no capacity for an engagement.</p>
            <p>To all which diſcourſe the Secretary anſwered; all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I could expect was the laſt, and the firſt day ſhould not be reckoned into the number of the 10 days.</p>
            <p>And yet once again I replied, ſithence the great Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:135601:57"/>to be aweary of us, and would neceſſitate us to go forth; I earneſtly deſired one thirty, or fourty dayes to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether our Ships at <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> adding, his Highneſſe the Great Duke muſt needs be acquainted what a vaſt ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>age the State of <hi>England</hi> hath been at to impreſs ſhips into their ſervice at <hi>Venice,</hi> and elſewhere; and if we be commanded out, and conſequently be forc't to engage ere thoſe ſhips can come to joyne, all their charge would be to no purpoſe; and I added, that is no ſmall matter.</p>
            <p>For but the other day having occaſion to converſe with the Admirall of the Great Dukes Gallies, he could tell me what ſhips we had fitting here and there, as well as my ſelf, and computed our preſent charge to be (when leaſt) an hundred and ſixty thouſand Crownes.</p>
            <p>In fine, again and again I am ſure more then ½. a dozen times, with all earneſtneſſe I did humbly beg but for thirty or fourty dayes time to get our ſhips together, and that the diſpute about the <hi>Phenix</hi> Friggot might make no obſtruction; the Secretary was proffer'd by Mr. <hi>Longland</hi> at my inſtance, as much money as the Friggot ſhould be judg'd worth, that he might do what he would withall. But ſeeing all our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were rendred fruitleſſe, and that the ſaid Secretary would harp upon no other ſtring then what is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted about giving us the firſt and the laſt day, I took my leave of him; and conſidering how more guns had been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought down, and planted againſt our ſhips; to what end I could not tell, except it were to further our deſtruction, if we were not gone at the time ſet us; and calling to minde how vain a thing it was ever counted to lie in the ditch, and not ſtirre to get out; I laboured in thoſe two or three dayes I remain'd at <hi>Legorn</hi> to put our ſhips in as good an equipage as I could, and went to Port <hi>Feraro</hi> to fetch up the reſt of our ſtrength that was there; and ſeeing how unready our ſhips were, and unlikely that even our ſhips ſhould get up to <hi>Legorne</hi> to ſuccour our friends before our ſet time would be expired: I wrote the Great Duke a few lines, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py whereof followeth.</p>

            <div type="reasons">
               <head>My reaſons for writing this Letter, and propounding ſuch Propoſitions, were briefly theſe.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, I was in very great hopes, that by this means the great Duke, who had expreſt himſelf in former times with ſo much bitterneſſe againſt Capt. <hi>Hall,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Appleton,</hi> for diſturbing of his Port, as he call'd it, although what they acted was far without ſhot of his Cannons; (as I have underſtood) would now have his ends in keeping of his Port unviolated, &amp; we ſhould have had our end in like manner by our conju<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ction: I was more eſpecially perſwaded of obtaining ſuch an effect, as is before denoted, conſidering that at this time, ſuch a number of the Captains &amp; others of the Dutch were in his cuſtody, for threatning to ſhoot down his Palace; that rather then <hi>Van Gallen</hi> would have been without their help, he would have agreed to what I had ſo reaſonably propounded; And I am yet apt to believe, the great Duke had never freed the Dutch out of priſon, nor yet have given them liberty to aſſault our ſhips within Musket-ſhot of his <hi>Mould</hi>-head, without the Golden Piſtols had flowne apace.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:135601:60"/>
               <p>Secondly, Although I had expreſt ſo much before to his Secretary of State, that no pretence might be laid upon me by the great Duke for withdrawing my word, I thought fit to open my ſelf to him, ſo freely and fully as I did by the ſaid Letter, to the end that he might be in a manner conſtrain'd to ſhew forth the nobleneſſe of his minde; and that reality of affection, which in all his Letters he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to bear unto the Parliament and Republick of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by ſaying,</p>

               <head>Yet there is one or two fallacious paſſages more that have ſlipt me, which I muſt needs give anſwer to.</head>
               <p>In <hi>Pag.</hi> 114. he tells a meer ſtory, (and you know what that is) ſaying the inſolency of the Dutch, caus'd by the unacquaintedneſſe of the time of our departure (after we knew it) conſtrain'd the great Duke to put divers of the Dutch Captains and others into priſon: Whereas by ſufficient teſtimony it will be made appear, the Dutch knew of the time when we were to be thruſt out of Port ſome days before us, and to that purpoſe had opportunity of hyring Felucas, and ſending them away with Dutch Captains or other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in them, this way and that way to call in their ſhips of ſtrength together; and being an eye-witneſſe of it my ſelf, I wondred what was a brewing, until the occaſion thereof was taken away by my being order'd to depart in ten dayes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what hath been before ſignified.</p>
               <p>Whereas it's ſaid, I might have ſtaid four dayes longer, it hath been ſufficiently prov'd by the great Dukes own Letter, and I know not what better proof to make, I could not have ſtaid an hour longer, without winde &amp; weather had hindred.</p>
               <p>And to ſay I came out by my own election, is a ſtory of the like nature with the former, and that is ſufficiently prov'd by what is before mentioned.</p>
               <p>But at length he that hath ſpread abroad in Print <hi>Signeur Montemagni</hi>'s relation, thinkes he hath ſtruck the naile on the head, ſaying, we had ſufficient advantage againſt the enemie, if our fight had been better manag'd.</p>
               <p>I would here appeal to all knowing men in the World, whether 'twas not likely to have been better manag'd, if the dealings of the great Duke, and his Miniſters with us had not been like unto ſuch as had betray'd us by the enſuing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, that may be added to what is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:135601:61"/>
               <p>FIrſt, As appeares by my Letters of the 2/21th. of <hi>Mar.</hi> wheras the great Dukes Secretary promis'd the Dutch Captains and others ſhould not be let out of priſon, unleſſe their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral would ſigne the Propoſitions, for keeping the great Dukes Port unviolated; and yet afterwards, when as we were come ſo neer, that there was no going back. I ſay now to let the Dutch out of priſon, and tell us plainly they would aſſault us, when our Ships ſternes were to the <hi>Mould.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas the great Duke and his Miniſters have many times told me, that if the Dutch at any time ſhould affront us within reach of his Cannons, all the force they could make, ſhould be diſcharg'd upon them; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding when it came to the point, ſhould ſuffer our ſhips to be ſurpriz'd within little more then Musket-ſhot of their workes, and not ſhoot a ſhot in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas the great Duke wrote me in the cloſe of his Letter dated the 9th. of <hi>March,</hi> he hop'd that fair winde and weather would put all our ſhips out of the <hi>Mould</hi> of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorn,</hi> that ſo the diſpute about the <hi>Phenix</hi> Friggot might be over; and yet notwithſtanding that his Colonel who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Legorn,</hi> and all that Sea-coaſt (as a ſubordinate Miniſter under him) ſhould give me to underſtand the 13th. of <hi>March ſtilo novo,</hi> that if the Engliſh ſhips of War had any further occaſion of their <hi>Mould</hi> of <hi>Legorn,</hi> the <hi>Phenix</hi> Frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got muſt be reſtored, which was as much to diſcourage us as poſſible could be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I would make but this one querie in the cloſe of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ADmit inferiour Officers ſhall have liberty to aſperſe their Commander in chief, (when as he ſhall think fit to call them off,) becauſe of ſo great a diſproportion between the enemies and themſelves. as is three or four to one, which was our caſe in <hi>Legorn</hi> Roade.</p>
               <p>And although ſome peradventure will ſay, what although you had as knowing Pilots on board as any were in the Fleet, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:135601:62"/>(howbeit) their opinion was if you had engaged any further about the <hi>Leopards</hi> relief, the great ſhips would be a ground together, and hazard the loſing of all that way; yet you ſhould have forc't the doing of what was in your own thoughts, with your ſword in the faces of them.</p>
               <p>Again, admit it be granted a Commander in chief ought to proſecute the ſervice he is upon, although the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of moſt of the nimble ſhips ſhould not act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what was required of them, but neglect their duty, ſo that he ſeeth he hath little or nothing to truſt to but his own ſhip; and howbeit the Marriners on board had prov'd formerly like a rotten ſtaffe, which deceives him that leans on it, he ought ſtill to carry on the ſervice, above all hope.</p>
               <p>Yet when the Commanders of one or both our Friggots, ſhall tell him their Maſts were ſhot through, and like to fall every moment, (as they were) conſidering we could not be furniſht in <hi>Legorn</hi> without ſurrendring the <hi>Phenix</hi> Frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got; would he not have been reputed as mad a man as any was in the world, to have renewed the engagement at that time?</p>
               <p>For ſuppoſe we could have reliev'd the <hi>Leopard,</hi> and not have been on ground, and brought her off, to be ſure by that time, all the Dutch Fleet, twenty and odde ſaile, that were ſtanding away to the Southward under our Lee, would have got the weather-gage of us; and if ſo, I think every one will grant, that although we might have defended our ſelves, yet it would have been an hundred to one, but on of the Frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots maimed Maſts, or ſome others would have gone by the board; and conſequently as the winde was, we muſt have gone into the great Dukes <hi>Mould</hi> for a ſupply; which if we had, we were told beforehand, (notwithſtanding the great Dukes Letter) the <hi>Phenix</hi> Friggot muſt be deliver'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now as things ſtood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although it might have been more to the honour of the Nation to ſave the <hi>Leopard,</hi> then the <hi>Phenix;</hi> yet in a word,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:135601:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>I ſuppoſe it would not be more to the profit of the Nation, if all things be conſidered.</p>
               <p>TO winde up all, when that fallacious Remonſtrance of a fight neer <hi>Legorn</hi> came to my hand, ſeeing the great Duke, his Secretary, and I know not whom beſides, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome of our Captains intereſt) all woven together; I thought of thoſe words, a threefold cord is not eaſily broken, how much leſſe that which may be compared to a ſevenfold cord, to draw on miſchief (if poſſible) on the heads of the States faithful Servants; yet a little skill, where there is hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and integrity, may make it like unto rotten tow; whether it hath or no, I ſhall not query.</p>
               <p>But in my proceeding in this ſhort diſcovery of Truth, I ſhal only ſay thus much by expreſſing what is before denoted; I have been cautious that none might be offended, except it be ſuch whoſe contentious ſpirits have ſufficiently diſcovered themſelves: And although that ſome may think Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s words concerning thoſe times, are like to prove true in all ages, (He that traceth Truth too neer at the heeles, may chance to have it kick out his teeth;) For my part, I am of another opinion, and do yet hope better of the preſent ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>But as a Gentleman expreſt himſelf not long ſince, upon another occaſion; I am in a land of miracles, meaning in <hi>England;</hi> I was thinking whether it may not be added, are we not in an age of miracles?</p>
               <p>That a Commander of a Force havein been ſent forth ſhould be ſo neglected, and as if he had been ſent abroad for d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, (although I confeſſe I had better hopes) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in forreigne parts, ſhould there conflict with as many hazards and troubles, as almoſt was poſſible for any
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:135601:63"/>man to undergo in the time; and yet when he ſhall come to his owne Countrey, hoping to finde that as good Harbour after a ſtorme, ſhall <hi>per contra</hi> be made liable to contempt from ſuch as have abſolutely diſobeyed commands, and have been the cauſes of all the damage which hath befallen the Nations in thoſe parts, in which he hath been, and few ſeem to take notice ot it.
